You've probably been hearing a lot about Bitcoin recently and are wondering what's the big deal?  Most of your questions should be answered by the resources below but if you have additional questions feel free to ask them in the comments.  

It all started with the release of **[Satoshi Nakamoto's whitepaper](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf)** however that will probably go over the head of most readers so we recommend the following articles/books/videos as a good starting point for understanding how Bitcoin works and a little about its long term potential:

* [Article: The Bullish Case for Bitcoin](https://medium.com/@vijayboyapati/the-bullish-case-for-bitcoin-6ecc8bdecc1)

You can also see the number of times Bitcoin was [declared dead by the media](https://99bitcoins.com/obituary-stats) (LOL!)

## Key properties of Bitcoin

* **Limited Supply** - There will only ever be a [maximum of 21,000,000 bitcoins created](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/10h04a6/this_is_how_we_know_theres_only_21_million_bitcoin/) and they are issued in a predictable fashion per the [inflation schedule](https://bashco.github.io/Bitcoin_Monetary_Inflation/).  Once they are all issued Bitcoin will be truly deflationary.  The [halving countdown](http://bitcoinblockhalf.com/) tells you approximately how much time until the next block reward halving.
* **Open source** - Bitcoin code is fully auditable.  You can read and contribute to the [source code](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin) yourself.
* **Accountable** - The public ledger is transparent, all transactions are [seen by everyone](https://blockstream.info/).
* **Decentralized** - Bitcoin is globally distributed across thousands of nodes with no single point of failure and as such can't be shut down similar to how [Bittorrent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent) works.  You can even [run a node on a Raspberry Pi](https://getumbrel.com/).  
* **Censorship resistant** - No one can prevent you from interacting with the Bitcoin network and no one can censor, alter or block transactions that they disagree with, see [Operation Chokepoint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Choke_Point).
* **Push system** - There are [no chargebacks](https://gendal.me/2013/10/21/lessons-from-bitcoin-push-versus-pull/) in Bitcoin because only the person who owns the address where the bitcoin resides has the authority to move them.
* **Borderless** - No country can stop it from going in/out, even in areas currently unserved by traditional banking as the ledger is [globally distributed](https://bitnodes.earn.com/).
* **Trustless** - Bitcoin solved the [Byzantine's Generals Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_fault_tolerance) which means nobody needs to trust anybody for it to work.
* **Pseudonymous** - No need to [expose personal information](https://buybitcoinworldwide.com/anonymity/) when purchasing with cash or transacting. 
* **Secure** - Blocks and transactions are cryptographically secured (using hashes and signatures) and can’t be [brute forced](http://i.imgur.com/fYFBsqp.jpg) or confiscated with proper key management such as hardware wallets.
* **Programmable** - Individual units of bitcoin can be [programmed to transfer](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Script) based on certain criteria being met
* **Divisible** - Each bitcoin can be [divided down to 8 decimals](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Satoshi_(unit\)), which means you don't have to worry about buying an entire bitcoin. 
* **Nearly instant** - From a few seconds on the Lightning Network to a [few minutes](https://www.blockchain.com/charts/median-confirmation-time) on-chain depending on need for confirmations.  Transactions are irreversible by normal users after one confirmation and irreversible by anyone (including miners) after 6 confirmations. 
* **Peer-to-peer** - No intermediaries taking a cut, no need for [trusted third parties](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/trusted-third-parties/).
* **Designed Money** - Bitcoin was created to fit all the [fundamental properties of money](http://i.imgur.com/wkTyyaV.png) better than gold or fiat.
* **Portable** - Bitcoin are digital so they are easier to move than cash or gold.  They can be transported by simply carrying a seed (a string of 12 to 24 words) on a device or by [memorizing it for wallet recovery](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Brainwallet) (while cool, memorizing is generally not recommended due to potential for forgetting the seed and the potential for insecure key generation by inexperienced users.  Hardware wallets are the preferred method for most users for their ease of use and additional security).
* **Low fee scaling** - Most wallets calculate on chain fees automatically but you can view [fee estimates](https://bitcoinfees.earn.com/) and [mempool activity](https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#0,2w) if you want to set your fee manually.  On chain fees may rise occasionally due to network demand, however instant micropayments that do not require confirmations are happening via the [Lightning Network](https://lightning.network/), an open source second layer payment protocol built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain. The Lightning Network enables Bitcoin users to instantly send and receive bitcoin with fees so low that they are negligible.
* **Scalable** - While the protocol is still being optimized for [increased transaction capacity](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Scalability), blockchains do not scale very well, so most transaction volume is expected to occur on Layer 2 networks built on top of Bitcoin.

## Where can I buy bitcoin?

[Bitcoin.org](https://bitcoin.org/en/buy) and [BuyBitcoinWorldwide.com](https://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/) are helpful sites for beginners.  You can buy or sell any amount of bitcoin (even just a few dollars worth) and there are several easy methods to purchase bitcoin with cash, credit card or bank transfer.  Some of the more popular places to buy bitcoin are listed below.

* [Strike](https://strike.me/)
* [Cash App](https://cash.app/)
* [Swan](https://www.swanbitcoin.com/)
* [River Financial](https://river.com/)
* [Bull Bitcoin](https://www.bullbitcoin.com/) 
* [Bitcoin Well](https://bitcoinwell.com/) 
* [Relai](https://relai.app/)
* [LibertyX](https://libertyx.com/)
* [CoinCorner](https://www.coincorner.com/)
* [RoboSats](https://learn.robosats.com/) (P2P)
* [Bisq](https://bisq.network/) (decentralized & P2P)
* [HodlHodl](https://hodlhodl.com/?filters%5Bcurrency_code%5D=USD) (P2P)
* [List of peer-to-peer exchanges](https://github.com/cointastical/P2P-Trading-Exchanges/)
* [Debifi](https://debifi.com/) (non-custodial lending)

You can also purchase in cash with [local ATMs](http://coinatmradar.com/). Services such as [CardCoins](https://www.cardcoins.co/) let you purchase bitcoin with prepaid gift cards. If you would like your paycheck automatically converted to bitcoin use [Bitwage](https://www.bitwage.com/).  

**Note:** Bitcoin are valued at whatever [market price](https://cryptowat.ch/bitstamp/btcusd) people are willing to pay for them in balancing act of supply vs demand. Unlike traditional markets, bitcoin markets operate 24 hours per day, 365 days per year. 

## Securing your bitcoin

With Bitcoin you can **""Be your own bank""** and personally secure your bitcoin **OR** you can use third party companies aka **""Bitcoin banks""** which will hold your bitcoin for you.

* If you prefer to **""Be your own bank""** and have direct control over your coins without having to use a trusted third party, then you will need to create your own wallet and keep it secure. If you want easy and secure storage without having to learn best computer security practices, then a hardware wallet such as a [BitBox02](https://bitbox.swiss/bitbox02/),  [Trezor](https://www.trezor.io/), [ColdCard](https://coldcardwallet.com/), or [Blockstream Jade](https://blockstream.com/jade/) is recommended. You can even build your own open source hardware wallets called a [SeedSigner](https://seedsigner.com/) or [Krux](https://selfcustody.github.io/krux/).

* If you cannot afford a hardware wallet there are many [software wallet](https://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet) options to choose from depending on your use case.  Mobile wallets like [BlueWallet](https://bluewallet.io/) are generally more secure than desktop wallets.  Beware of fake mobile wallets and check reviews from reputable Bitcoin websites.  Avoid paper wallets or brain wallets.

* If you prefer to work with third party **""Bitcoin banks""** to set up a collaborative custody arrangement, try [Unchained Capital](https://unchained-capital.com/) but be aware that any third party you use exposes you to third party risk.  There is a saying in the community, **""Not your keys, not your coins""**. 

**Note: For increased security, use Two Factor Authentication (2FA) everywhere it is offered, including email!** 

2FA requires a second confirmation code or a physical security key to access your account making it much harder for thieves to gain access.  Google Authenticator and Authy are the two most popular 2FA services, download links are below.  Make sure you create backups of your 2FA codes.

**Avoid using your cell number for 2FA.**  Hackers have been using a technique called ""SIM swapping"" to impersonate users and steal bitcoin off exchanges.

Google Auth | Authy | OTP Auth | andOTP
--------------|--------|------------|--------
[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2) | [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.authy.authy&hl=en) | N/A | [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.shadowice.flocke.andotp)
[iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-authenticator/id388497605?mt=8) | [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/authy/id494168017) | [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/otp-auth/id659877384) | N/A

Physical security keys (FIDO U2F) offer stronger security than Google Auth / Authy and other TOTP-based apps, because the secret code never leaves the device and it uses bi-directional authentication so it prevents phishing. If you lose the device though, you could lose access to your account, so always use 2 or more security keys with a given account so you have backups. See [Yubikey](https://yubikey.com/) or [Titan](https://cloud.google.com/titan-security-key) to purchase security keys.

## Running Bitcoin

You can run [Bitcoin node](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/18736/what-is-a-bitcoin-node) software by downloading and installing [Bitcoin Core](https://bitcoincore.org) or other node software you have vetted. 

It is a best practice to verify these Bitcoin node programs you download by [checking their hashes and signatures](https://youtu.be/U0I-ImS_r8o?si=qa_gRyGPuRZq5acM). 

Don't Trust, Verify.

* https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/releases
* https://bitcoincore.org
* https://bitcoin.org/en/bitcoin-core/

A verified Bitcoin node running on your own hardware is your sovereign gateway to the Bitcoin network. They can be used alongside open source software [wallets](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Wallet) to send and receive Bitcoin securely. By running your own Bitcoin node, you enforce the Bitcoin ruleset, can verify transactions without trusted 3rd party middlemen, improve your Bitcoin privacy, obtain independence with local access to blockchain data, and help bolster the robustness of the Bitcoin network. By running a Bitcoin node, you are verifying that Bitcoin is Bitcoin for yourself. For more details on running a Bitcoin node see [this article](https://unchained.com/blog/why-run-bitcoin-node/). 

For wallets used alongside your Bitcoin node: If your Bitcoin wallet software is fully [open source](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/80111/is-bitcoin-completely-open-source/80115#80115) and Bitcoin-only, then it is probably a decent wallet. Some popular examples include [sparrow wallet](https://sparrowwallet.com/) and [electrum wallet](https://electrum.org/), both of which you can connect to your own locally run Bitcoin node, and use with most Bitcoin Hardware Wallets.

## Watch out for scams

As mentioned above, Bitcoin is decentralized, which by definition means there is no official website or Twitter handle or spokesperson or CEO. However, all money attracts thieves. This combination unfortunately results in scammers running official sounding names or pretending to be an authority on YouTube or social media. Many scammers throughout the years have claimed to be the inventor of Bitcoin. Websites like bitcoin(dot)com and the r / btc subreddit are active scams.  Almost all altcoins are marketed heavily with big promises but are really just designed to separate you from your bitcoin.  So be careful: any resource, including all linked in this document, may in the future turn evil.  As they say in our community, **""Don't trust, verify""**. 

* Avoid using ad-based search engines like Google or Yahoo: ads are shown based on how much the advertiser bids, and scammers can easily outbid legitimate providers for ad space, since immoral ways of earning money are far more lucrative than moral ways.  Use [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/) instead, which has no ads, and never tracks you as well.
* Ignore private messages offering services.
* **Never enter your seed words in a website of any kind.** Hardware wallets will recover by displaying possible seed words on their own interface, never on a website.
* **Always check addresses on your hardware wallet before sending or receiving.**  Some malware has been known to replace addresses in your web browser or that you copy-and-paste.
* Avoid clicking on links like that look like links, such as [https://www.google.com/](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ybW48rKBME), without first hovering over it and actually checking where they go to.  Just because a link is labelled with an HTTPS address does not mean it actually sends you to that address.  It is trivial for someone to comment a link on Reddit that looks like it will send you to one website when it actually sends you to another, and you might not notice the difference until a scammer has gotten all your money, or you have downloaded and installed software that steals your money.

## Can I mine bitcoin?

Mining bitcoin can be a fun learning experience, but be aware that you will most likely operate at a loss.  Newcomers are often advised to stay away from mining unless they are only interested in it as a hobby similar to [folding at home](https://foldingathome.org/?lng=en).  If you want to learn more about mining you can read the [mining FAQ](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Faq#Mining). Still have mining questions?  The crew at /r/BitcoinMining would be happy to help you out. 

If you want to contribute to the Bitcoin network by hosting the blockchain and propagating transactions there are many [great resources](https://raspibolt.org/) you can use to [run a full node](https://river.com/learn/how-to-run-a-bitcoin-node/).  You can view the global distribution of reachable Bitcoin nodes on [this webpage.](https://bitnodes.io/nodes/all/#global-bitcoin-nodes)

## Bitcoin Units

One bitcoin is worth quite a lot (thousands of £/$/€), so people often deal in smaller units. The most common subunits are listed below:

Unit | Symbol | Value | Info
---|:---:|---|---
bitcoin | BTC | 1 bitcoin | one bitcoin is equal to 100 million satoshis
millibitcoin | mBTC | 1,000 per bitcoin | used as default unit in Electrum wallet
bit | μBTC | 1,000,000 per bitcoin | colloquial ""slang"" term for microbitcoin
satoshi | sat | 100,000,000 per bitcoin | smallest unit in bitcoin, named after the inventor

For example, assuming an arbitrary exchange rate of $10,000 for one bitcoin, a $10 meal would equal:

* 0.001 BTC
* 1 mBTC
* 1,000 bits
* 100,000 sats

For more information check out the [bitcoin units wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinWiki/wiki/bitcoin_units).

	1.	Peter Todd’s timeline: Todd got involved in the Bitcoin community around 2011, which is after Satoshi had already disappeared (Satoshi stopped being active in 2010). Todd himself has confirmed this timeline and never claimed to be involved in creating Bitcoin.
	2.	Different communication styles: Satoshi’s writing style and approach to Bitcoin’s design is different from Todd’s. Satoshi was really focused on decentralization, while Todd has been more involved in discussions about improving Bitcoin’s privacy and scalability, but from a more pragmatic standpoint.
	3.	Public statements: Todd has always denied being Satoshi and said that it wouldn’t make sense for him to hide his identity if he was, considering how open he’s been in the Bitcoin world.
	4.	Technical focus: While both are skilled in cryptography, Todd’s work has mainly focused on specific improvements to Bitcoin, like time-stamping services and fixing transaction malleability, rather than creating the network itself.

These factors, along with what Todd has said himself, makes it clear he isn’t Satoshi Nakamoto."

Pays daily wages in bitcoin: ""Why do we only get paid once a month?""



The developers wanted to test a new salary model. Now employees can choose to receive wages daily—in bitcoin. ""A tax risk,"" says a BI professor.



Salary models in Norwegian companies are relatively standardized today.



You do your job, and you get your salary deposited into your account once a month.



Now, the developers at the IT consulting company Snøkam are testing a new model they believe is fairer for employees.



“Why should you be paid for work you did three weeks ago?” asks senior consultant Simen Johnsrud.



The new model allows employees who wish to receive part of their monthly salary daily, in bitcoin, based on how many hours they worked that day.



Here’s how the arrangement works:



Employees can choose a percentage of their total monthly salary to be paid out daily throughout the month, instead of receiving the entire amount at the end of the month as usual.

The daily amount to be paid to the employees' accounts is converted into bitcoin before being sent.



“We asked ourselves: ‘Why do we only get paid once a month?’ and we couldn’t find any good answers—quite the opposite. It’s just always been that way, and it’s tailored to current routines,” says Johnsrud.



“One answer might be that running payroll has typically been a large manual process. We want to spend as little time as possible on manual tasks, so we’ve implemented automation wherever possible,” he adds.



Johnsrud provides an example to better explain the model.



“If an employee in the company earns 20,000 kroner a month, and there are 20 working days in the month, they will earn 1,000 kroner per day. If they choose to get 10% paid in bitcoin, that amounts to 100 kroner a day.”



Currently, seven out of eleven employees at the company have chosen to receive part of their salary in this way.



For now, Snøkam has set a maximum limit of 10% that can be paid out daily while testing the model. However, they aim to increase the limit over time.



The average percentage chosen so far is around 8%.



A bit ""unfair""



""But doesn't this just create a lot of hassle in accounting and more work than necessary for payroll?""



""As consultants, we work by the hour, so it’s very easy to see what our daily wage should be when we go home for the day. It’s also a bit 'unfair' for the employee that the company can withhold wages and earn money from it, as opposed to paying immediately for the work that’s been done. From that theory to payout in practice, the transition was not difficult for us,” says Johnsrud.



He explains that the daily amounts are automatically registered as an advance payment on the payslip.



At the end of the month, the advance payments are summed up and subtracted from the total amount.



“These amounts are deducted from what we calculate to be the employee’s exact monthly salary, so there are no errors, either in taxes or in the paid salary. The monthly reconciliation becomes the control for the entire system,” Johnsrud explains.



“So why pay out part of the salary in bitcoin?”



“Some of us are interested in crypto and wanted to explore the advantages of paying daily wages in bitcoin versus a regular payroll system,” he says.



Bitcoin is known for being a risky investment because its prices fluctuate greatly. As a result, many well-known investors and fund managers have warned against investing in cryptocurrency.



What do you and the other employees think about the volatility of bitcoin prices?



“As long as you can choose the risk you want to take by adjusting the daily rate, it’s easier to accept a fluctuating rate,” Johnsrud says.



“It’s completely voluntary for employees to participate in the bitcoin arrangement or not. We also understand the issue with paying 100% of wages in bitcoin, since it can’t be used everywhere. So, it’s good that you can choose how much you want to commit,” he adds.



A tax risk



Espen Ekberg is a professor of economic history at BI Norwegian Business School.



“This is interesting, and they are free to create the payroll system they want, but it’s strange that the company wants to pay wages in bitcoin. A common definition of salary is that the employee receives compensation in money, and bitcoin cannot be considered money. It could become that, but it doesn’t have this function today,” he says.



“Money should be used as a medium of exchange and must hold value well. The basic premise of a salary is that your labor should be worth a certain amount of purchasing power, and it shouldn’t depreciate too much over time,” he says.



Ekberg also points to a tax risk for employees who opt into the scheme:



“Those who have agreed to this will never know exactly how much bitcoin they will receive each week. But they still have to pay taxes based on their salary in kroner. If you have a salary of 800,000 kroner, and 10% is paid in bitcoin, you still have to pay taxes based on the 800,000 kroner. Therefore, there’s a clear risk if the bitcoin rate fluctuates significantly,” he says.



“Some people like risk and enjoy playing with it, but I don’t quite understand the reason for trying this. It’s very strange,” Ekberg adds.



He also notes that salary hasn’t always been paid monthly.



“You don’t have to go far to find completely different systems. In the U.S., for example, bi-weekly payments are quite normal. In Norway, we’ve also had different salary systems. Monthly payments became common when banks started offering salary accounts in the 1960s. Before that, wages were often paid weekly, in cash,” the professor adds.



“So far, we’ve found one café in Oslo that accepts bitcoin”



Aksel Øvern is the CEO of Snøkam and also works as a consultant.



“Would it have been possible to do this with regular Norwegian kroner? That is, pay salaries as normal, but daily instead of monthly?”



“Payments in Norwegian kroner have some limitations since they go through the traditional banking system. First and foremost, these transactions require signing with BankID in our accounting system, which would have made this solution practically impossible. Our finance manager would have had to sign every single daily transaction for every employee with BankID,” Øvern responds.



“The traditional banking system would also have significantly limited this solution due to long transaction times, depending on the time of day, working hours, weekends, and holidays. The transactions we do today with bitcoin are received within a minute after the consultant logs their hours. This works regardless of the time of day, working hours, weekends, and holidays,” Øvern continues.



Now, he and Johnsrud hope that the arrangement will catch on, and that more restaurants and shops in the capital will begin to accept the volatile cryptocurrency as a means of payment.



“What each employee does with their bitcoins once they’re in their account will be interesting. We believe, and hope, that the adoption of bitcoin and cryptocurrency over time will allow us to use these currencies for daily expenses in Norway. So far, we’ve found one café in Oslo that accepts bitcoin. Fortunately, it’s located right by our office at Nationaltheatret,” says Øvern."

When I clicked it, the app told there were unspent bitcoin that were on standby, because I took too long to use it. So I transferred the 300000 and discovered later that the unspent were 380000 sats.

Glassnode data reveals reserves have plummeted to about 2.58 million BTC, a level unseen since 2018. This trend coincides with Bitcoin's price doubling this year, prompting questions about the rationale behind this movement.

Analysts speculate that investors are increasingly transferring their assets off exchanges to safeguard their crypto holdings instead of selling. This shift hints at a growing expectation of a substantial price upswing and a desire to protect against centralized platform volatility.

The ongoing outflows of Bitcoin from exchanges not only hint at a potential surge in demand but also underscore a broader transition towards off-exchange transactions. This shift reflects a changing mindset among Bitcoin holders, prioritizing autonomy and secure asset management in the dynamic cryptocurrency landscape. 

Are the investors expecting a significant surge in price and preparing for a demand drastic increase?"

I once unburdened here in a point of my life when I was feeling down while seeing no bright future ahead. I separated from my ex, my wage was miserable, my rent was crazy. And I was like, ""should I just put X savings into btc?"" in hopes I would get richer in a few years because I was sick of being poor.

The best advice people gave me was as simple as this: ""better yourself and make yourself more valuable"" because just diving in BTC without a plan just isn't enough.

I started investing in myself. For the last 2 or 3 years I exercised more, I took a course, I ate better, I got more and more valuable in my job to the point of getting promotions and making my bosses tremble whenever I mention leaving. I found a cheaper rent and I found a new woman who loves me and understands boundaries.

I am more confident and feel better, and despite the incredible higher costs of living today, I feel safer and more hopeful about the future because I have BTC."

Since the start of COVID I believe the entire economy will now be in a perpetual state of inflation. This means the rich will truly get richer while the poorer get poorer. I’m not saying this as a bull case for bitcoin. The US debt is too large, and if we did enter a deflationary rate it would be too expensive for the government. They can’t pay it. It’s impossible. 

That being said I believe that right now might be the most important time to buy assets, and ride the wave of this inflationary hell. Not to make money. No. Just to survive and keep up with inflation.

However, if we add other ""more realistic"" assumptions on distribution, you need 10 BTC to be in the top 0.1%

-----Details below-----

To determine how much Bitcoin you need to hold to be in the top 0.1%, 1%, and 10% of Bitcoin holders globally, we can model the distribution of Bitcoin holdings using a Gaussian (normal) distribution. Here's a comprehensive analysis based on the given assumptions:

# Assumptions

* **Total Bitcoin Supply:** 21,000,000 BTC
* **World Population:** 8,000,000,000 people
* **Distribution Model:** Gaussian (Normal) Distribution

# Calculating the Mean Holding

First, calculate the average (mean) Bitcoin holding per person:

Mean(μ)=Total Bitcoin/World Population=0.002625 BTC per person

# Determining the Standard Deviation

In a Gaussian distribution, the mean and standard deviation (σ) define the spread of the data. However, the total Bitcoin supply constrains the distribution. For simplicity, we'll assume that the standard deviation is equal to the mean:σ=μ=0.002625 BTC*σ*=*μ*=0.002625 BTC *Note: This is a simplification. In reality, Bitcoin holdings are likely more skewed, but for the purpose of this calculation, we proceed with this assumption.*

# Calculating Bitcoin Holdings for Top Percentiles

Using the properties of the normal distribution, we can determine the Bitcoin holdings required to be in the top 0.1%, 1%, and 10%.

# Top 0.1%

* **Z-score for 99.9th Percentile:** ≈ 3.09
* **Required Holdings:**

x=μ+zσ=0.002625+(3.09×0.002625)≈0.0105 BTC *x*=*μ*+*zσ*=0.002625+(3.09×0.002625)≈0.0105 BTC

# Top 1%

* **Z-score for 99th Percentile:** ≈ 2.326
* **Required Holdings:**

x=μ+zσ=0.002625+(2.326×0.002625)≈0.0087 BTC *x*=*μ*+*zσ*=0.002625+(2.326×0.002625)≈0.0087 BTC

# Top 10%

* **Z-score for 90th Percentile:** ≈ 1.282
* **Required Holdings:**

x=μ+zσ=0.002625+(1.282×0.002625)≈0.00599 BTC *x*=*μ*+*zσ*=0.002625+(1.282×0.002625)≈0.00599 BTC

# Summary of Required Bitcoin Holdings

|**Top Percentile**|**Z-score**|**Bitcoin Needed**|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Top 0.1%|3.09|≈ 0.0105 BTC|
|Top 1%|2.326|≈ 0.0087 BTC|
|Top 10%|1.282|≈ 0.0060 BTC|

# Conclusion

Under the assumption of a Gaussian distribution of Bitcoin holdings across the global population:

* **To be in the top 0.1%,** you need to hold approximately **0.0105 BTC**.
* **To be in the top 1%,** you need to hold approximately **0.0087 BTC**.
* **To be in the top 10%,** you need to hold approximately **0.0060 BTC**.

# A more realistic model:

Given the skewed distribution, the Bitcoin needed to be in specific percentiles increases significantly compared to the Gaussian model.

* **Top 0.1%:**
   * **Estimated Holdings:** ≈ 10 BTC
* **Top 1%:**
   * **Estimated Holdings:** ≈ 1.133 BTC
* **Top 10%:**
   * **Estimated Holdings:** ≈ 0.1 BTC"

- My hot wallet is telling me the address starting with bc1 is a taproot address, but an article I read says it's Native Segwit. I am absolutely lost...

Thanks!"

So then it's like an ongoing fee similar to what etfs charge but this component is from the chain itself.

Most tradfi investors are already paying such a fee to the etf sponsor. A component just gets added in here attributed to the blockchain itself.

This approach allows for a permanent and sustained way of funding the security budget, doing so in a way that truthfully maintains Bitcoin's core proposition as a scarce asset with a capped supply and in a way that is not at all unfamiliar to most traditional investors."

But I had this, lets say food for thought!

This chain of thought started when I saw a YouTube comment asking how will a new grad get/payback a loan to buy a house if BTC is getting more expensive with time. 

My instant reaction was that one can save from his labor and buy in a few yrs without a loan, and the house would also get cheaper in btc terms each year. This may be true, but it doesn't always work, as there are legit reasons for getting loans like starting a business, higher education etc. 

So then I thought a bit more and it made it think that maybe the best case scenario would be to only have incomes (earned MONEY against which work/value has already been delivered aka proof of real work) being in BTC. 

Everything else aka credit (ie. CURRENCY - the value/work is yet to be delivered) in USD(T) , which can be inflated aka credit creation via loan, to start a new business, buy a house, higher education etc etc. 
These currencies should be directly pegged to BTC by a simple total currency / total btc ratio, so BTC essentially absorbs all inflation and evenly distributes it amongst holders.

This way, BTC savings/holders never lose any purchasing power via inflation, but at the same time we have enough currency/liquidity for the economy to function (by being able to start new business, buy house, higher education etc) 

BTC holders would sell their MONEY ie. BTC and convert to any of the currencies, whenever they either want to consume or invest into anything. 

This way labor never gets devalued, but instead your labor aka your BTC income (and thus BTC savings) will capture all the economic growth with time, by adjusting with the currency inflation.

IMO, the problem with only having BTC as money is the possibility of Hoarding. At a point the large holders/hoarders may never want to risk their BTC (since they can just capture the market growth anyway so why risk it?). Even if these large hoaders spend lavishly, that won't be enough for somebody wanting to start a business, higher education, buy a house etc) 

At that point, if BTC if the only medium of exchange aka BTC standard, it's price or borrowing yield will become too much for anybody to risk/willingly borrow and start a business. This would then most likely kill innovation, which is never good. 

We also need those currencies as direct BTC based loans don't make a lot of sense, if getting your hands on BTC is becoming harder and harder with time. Almost nobody would able to payback, unless you manage to grow more than the market (aka BTC price appreciation against real goods/services) + the interest yield. 

People can instead borrow any of the currencies to start a businesses, buy BTC instantly, since they need to pay incomes in btc, and they also start capturing the market growth /inflation via BTC as soon as possible. 
The people / business can then convert back to any currency at the time of buying / investing into anything (except for labor, which will be paid in BTC directly). 
This way until the business uses their BTC, they keep getting the market growth via BTC price appreciation (against currencies / real goods). This would help paying down (at least a part of) the currency debt/interest. 
This makes sense, as it essentially means the economy / market is producing enough to subsidize all business loans /risk taking (to a certain extent), which would breed innovation instead. 

This way the entire society including both individuals and businesses get the benefit of the overall productivity, rather than only the people close to the printers or high executives who decide their own salary / bonuses. 
But at the same time, we wouldn't risk bringing economy to an halt and stifling innovation /sensible risk taking, due to hoarding scenarios. 

Open to thoughts / finding loop holes in this theory!

PS:
There is also a psychological change that happens with hard money, where people tend to hoard and not want to spend. The fiat currencies going up will again give them an illusion of wealth, basically how stocks and real state work, and stimulate the economy.

I don’t have a lot of savings overall, but some of what I have is in BTC and has gotten to a point I would like to potentially take a little out to handle some expenses. 

I’m in the US and mostly purchased via Coinbase, but also have Gemini and Binance US accounts as there were a couple alts at the time I foolishly chased that were not available on CB.

My funds are on hardware wallets now. If I wanted to take a little out next bull run to handle some life expenses- what is the best approach to pay what I need in fees and taxes to stay legal but not more.  If I transfer it back to Coinbase they have fees to convert BTC back to fiat, then pay capital gains tax using FIFO is that all their is to it?

I’ve been using Cointracker and Koinly but neither are 100% accurate as when I was younger and goofing around when I was like 16-17 I bought a bunch of alts that went nowhere, got scammed a few times along the way, lost money in Celsius and BlockFi that each paid back via PayPal, bought a couple small things online with BTC just to see if I could, did a little mining from my laptop, straight up screwed up and lost BTC while learning how it all works— essentially a big mess.  Past couple years I used those apps to kinda guesstimate what to pay in taxes but know they are not 100%.  It was under the idea of “just do your best to figure it out and pay something” to keep the IRS from putting a microscope on you. 

So I am trying to pay due tax when I take a little out, and figured worse case scenario I should do fifo from here out just in case and pay max tax so if ever audited I won’t someday get spanked with a big past due tax bill of in trouble of any kind tax wise.  That said, I got a smidge early like 2017 when I was just a kid experimenting and it’s worth a decent amount more now and paying tax on that gain kinda sucks so just want to make sure I’m not missing the boat and doing this foolishly in a way that I’m leaving too much $ on the table.  

What is the lower cost legal way to DCA out a smidge here and there along the way?  Or is my plan to transfer back to Coinbase and just pay the tax on the gains based on what koinly says ok despite it not being 100% accurate?

If the IRS ever wants to audit me I’d like to be in a position to say I did everything I could to pay what I thought was right and not be screwed.  Not looking to be a target.

Thanks all

I played with leverage and lost money on speculative assets. Many people, including myself, come to make money. Some gamble and strike it big, but most eventually lose everything. Those who avoid ending up broken and bitter are the ones who research projects, build convictions around them, and become community builders and utility creators. Alternatively (quite often additionally), they genuinely understand Bitcoin.


The key difference between Bitcoin and other cryptos is that most projects are companies, whereas Bitcoin is a protocol. If something negative happens to Mark Zuckerberg or Elon Musk, their respective company’s stocks will plummet. Bitcoin, however, has no such vulnerability. The inventor has disappeared.

Gravity doesn't require trust because it's a fundamental protocol of nature. When you drop something, its weight is verified. Similarly, Bitcoin's value is verifiable, making trust unnecessary. 

Bitcoin invites us to look beyond speculation and build conviction on its unshakeable foundation. The gravity of truth holds: verifiable, trustless, and unassailable. Rise above the noise and trust the protocol.

We could always just launch some satellites with bitcoin nodes to orbit the sun. There would always be one communicating with earth, and they could communicate with each other around the orbit to update on a delay so there would be minimal catching up to do as the farther ones approach earth each year, or less depending on the speed and direction of orbit.

No more unjust scales no more unjust weights. Bitcoin is here to stay. It can change the course of humanity as we know it. 

God helped me understand it, and when he did, I was trembling in fear I was vomiting. Everything became clear. It brought me closer to God.

There are evils in this world that want to control and manipulate you.

Jesus sacrifice his own life for us whether we believe in them or not, and that’s more important than bitcoin. 

The system is coming down 

Thank God for Bitcoin 🙏🏿

I’m just looking for perspective. If Michael Saylor prediction is true, I feel like starting a business isn’t needed given the enormous upfront capital and risks I need to take to establish a successful business. Investing into Bitcoin is risky too and does require a large capital but it’s been giving me better ROI compared to my online business where profit margins are low and I need to put more money into the product I’m selling. Building a profitable business takes years too. 

I know most people gravitate toward starting a business, but some days I think just investing into Bitcoin is a better option. I still work a full time 9-5 job, but my goal is to just achieve financial independence. "

1. BTC as a store of value - he believes BTC cannot simply remain as a store of value. if everyone simply relies on it to go up in value and use it to create big gains it will fail. we have to transact in it and use it as an alternative to cash/money. Using it to make money and as a derivative as in shorts/longs/ loans/yields etc will result in failure. 

2. ETF’s will get confiscated - if governments try to use it as a reserve currency won’t work. Will result in ETF’s being confiscated like gold before it. And as in the past it would be used to prop up the currency until no longer enough, which would result in long term price suppression that would hurt BTC long term. 

I’m too smooth brained to give the full detail is on all this but would love to hear people’s thoughts on this. Made a lot of sense tho for sure.

Now I have my four winners:

1) Get on Nostr. It is a social media platform and by providing value (comments, photos, even memes) you will get zapped Satoshis. Please be a part of the community and zap also back, it is like an upvote at Reddit!

2) Ember. It is an app (Apple & Google Store) where you can mine together with your friends and contacts. I make currently something like 15-20 Sats an hour(!) by only investing about 10 minutes a day. I have a referral in case you want a kickstart (+10 sats/hr) over there. 

3) Fountain App for podcast listening. There are great podcasts over there about Bitcoin, politics, but you can also listen to your standard Apple Podcast / Spotify podcasts over there. Every day you will get a few sats for listening! No brainer 🧡

4) THNDR Games. They have a few mini games (Bitcoin Snake, Tetris) where you can play a little and get Sats every hour. It is not much, I usually get for one game of Snake which takes maybe 2 minutes like 4 sats. Payout is every hour and it is connected to Wallets like Strike, Primal and Wallet of Satoshi, so it is super intuitive. I have made here maybe 100-200 sats and play from time to time just for fun.

If you know any more, I’d be happy to hear your recommendations! Keep stacking guys!

163,Studying Comptia Security+. Presently studying cryptographic algorithms and the history of cryptography. I feel like the quantum treat is at least 20 years away.,3,1fwu7wk,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1fwu7wk/studying_comptia_security_presently_studying/,7,2024-10-05 21:56:25,"Please take what I say with a massive grain of salt. I'm not a dev, nor a coder. I'm simply studying for something that can bolster my career moving forward.               

Doing a brief search on the world's first invented cryptographic algorithm, known as ""Data Encryption Standard"", it was invented in the 1970s. It was broken by a brute force attack in 1997 that took 56 hours to complete. There were attempts to extend the usefulness of DES by (my own words, no one elses) tripling the number of times it encrypts and re-encrypts information. DES was 56-bit encryption. ""Triple DES"" was essentially 111 bit encryption.               

At this point, organizations came together to formulate a new encryption standard and created a cryptographic algorithm for web browsing and information sharing that almost everyone uses today known as ""Advanced Encryption Standard"" (AES).            

My postulation is that, given the timeline between the introduction of DES to the time it was cracked, and given the introduction of quantum computers and that they are presently very weak (not to mention the fact that the components need to operate at nearly absolute zero (literally -273 degrees celsius (-460 degrees farenheit))), I view the quantum threat to Sha-256 as null now, and needing at least 20 years of development to break sha-256. Further, for perspective, to construct a quantum computer that could do this in today's numbers, the computer would need to be the size of a football field.            

**All of the difficulties associated with breaking SHA-256 placed to the side, would it be possible to use a soft-fork similar to speedy trial back in 2021 to move to a new hashing algorithm?**"

Citizens that donate 100,000 sats to the national bitcoin strategic reserve, state Bitcoin reserve, or a local community Bitcoin reserve, will receive a $500.00 tax credit.

I don't want to dox myself but my work has been covered, cited, and taught in a few classrooms. Anyway I noticed something a few years ago from behavior that happened to also apply to how money can appear in society, and I couldn't resist working on and formalizing it even though I'm not an economist and don't know any. But this is pretty relevant to the arguments people have about bitcoin and how it supposedly lacks ""intrinsic value."" Anyway here's a brief outline.

1. People have made different claims for where money's value comes from. Some say government fiat, but government can't control money when it hyperinflates. Some have said trust, or that money is useful because you can use it as money, but these take a form of circular logic. They don't explain why the first people want forms of money before they're widely known or anyone wants to trade for them. To counter this, some people have pointed out that money starts out as something practically useful, like wheat or cigarettes in prison, that then gets traded. But gold didn't have practical use before things like electroplating or dentistry, but was still valued. And even the beauty of gold doesn't explain why other beautiful things, like crystals or pyrite, didn't have the same value. And likewise, bitcoin has no appearance or supposed practical use at all. But it turns out the desire for it is based on real value, like so...
2. People have a tendency to keep scarce and unfamiliar items, since they might be potentially useful, in the same way we keep knick-knack drawers at home. And having those items means that the person was either able to go to unfamiliar territories to find them, meaning they had more capability than average, or they acquired the item through force or treachery from someone who had gone there, meaning they still were more capable than average. Because of that higher capability and those items sometimes turning to genuinely be more useful (like making sharper weapons), these people survived more often than average.
3. These people also had friends and mates, who were more likely to survive as well because they were with someone who was more capable than average and they had items that sometimes were more useful as well.
4. As a result, people over time developed an instinct to want scarce items and to want to be around people who had scarce items. People then would display their scarce items as well as a sign of capability, and sometimes give those scarce items to others to show that they are allied with capable people or capable themselves.
5. The scarce items that were durable (could be displayed longer), evenly divisible (so they could be smaller gifts or represent smaller amounts of value), hard to fake (so they were more reliable as signs of fitness) and transferable and so on got traded around more often and eventually became what we call money.
6. Bitcoin has an instinctive attraction to people who know about its programmed scarcity for the same reason we are attracted to any other item we know is scarce. And this attraction is based on real survival value (having scarce items shows capability still today) and thus bitcoin has a real basis for why people want it. On top of, of course, now being useful for trade.

What I like about this is that, in addition to showing why money without ""practical use"" actually is still based on real value, it indicates that you don't need government or some organizer to create or force ""trust"" or ""agreement"" among people for any form of money to exist. It simply occurs on its own if it has the necessary traits. And even if people don't agree or think a form of money isn't valuable, we'll still evolve those urges over time (and thus our interest and use of money) because people have real reason to keep scarce items, and the value they provide in their use and what they show about someone's fitness is real as well and will effect our evolution.

Anyway I'm asking people who have a background in economics and the related theories what they think about this, and would appreciate any feedback someone has. I have drafted a couple preprints on this that go into a lot more detail on it, and I may publish it if it does turn out to have any use. "

I have a similar question regarding, S&p 500. 
Let's say, S&P 500 gets a constant bid from investors all across and they keep allocating money on a monthly basis, while s&p 500 doesn't have a fixed supply a constant bid to buy s&p 500 would make it an up only asset isn't it?  And could keep going up even if s&p 500 gets overvalued.

I see I can convert my usd to btc or other crypto but then I dunno what I can do with a bunch of crypto besides letting it potentially grow but that's pointless if I have no way of withdrawing my money.

While the halving reduces supply, wouldn't the overall liquidity in the global markets (due to central bank policies, interest rates, etc.) have a stronger influence on the price of Bitcoin? For example, when liquidity is high, more capital tends to flow into riskier assets like BTC. But in tighter liquidity conditions, investors might shy away from volatile assets.

Has anyone else considered this? What are your thoughts on how much global liquidity affects Bitcoin's price cycles compared to the halving?"

It was posted 12h ago on [Twitter](https://x.com/BitBuyer313/status/1841459316051603874) by [@BitBuyer313](https://x.com/BitBuyer313)

No matter how hopeless and bleak your financial situation is, never give up. Here's my own personal story and a peek into my past.

Let's rewind back to 2011, I was 5 years into a drug and drinking problem, got a DUI, went to prison and when I got out I was over $30k in debt due to fines, lawyer fees etc.

I had to move back into my dad's house and the drug problem continued.
By 2013 most of my friends were dead from drug overdoses, or in prison and I was still $25k in debt.
I realized I was going to end up dead or in prison as well if I didn't make a change.

I managed to find myself an efficiency apartment I could afford, and the local fire department was gracious enough to give me a chance since my prison record was only DUI related.
I worked full time, and on evenings and weekends I went to fire school for an entire summer (till I was interior certified), helped with fundraisers, and started paying off my debt.

Being on the flip side of drugs was a sobering experience, most of the medical calls we ran were fentanyl overdoses and it was eye opening to see the devastation drugs caused the immediate family members of the addicted individual, I witnessed more death in one year than most people will experience in their entire lives.

Surrounding myself with a new group of friends from the fire dept and staying busy by working and volunteering 24/7 was enough to keep me out of trouble. 

By 2016 my debt was finally paid off and I actually had several grand in savings but never thought I'd be able to retire due to understanding how rampantly out of control inflation was, I was looking into gold, real estate etc. to figure out where I could start parking my money, but nothing seemed to be the perfect solution.

Then one day in early summer of 2017 I discovered Bitcoin while watching a documentary on the silk road. I was immediately fascinated. I studied it for a couple weeks and finally pulled the trigger making my first purchases 2 weeks before the fork wars kicked into full gear.

I was unsure if I made the right decision at the time, my friends laughed at me, and my family was concerned I fell victim to a Ponzi scheme, but I didn't let any criticism dissuade me. Then came the euphoric pump to $20k, I felt vindicated till the price collapsed and I received even more mockery for not selling. This rinse and repeat happened for another full cycle, but I had made up my mind that I was riding my #Bitcoin stack to zero or to a million. 

With each passing year my conviction only grew stronger as my knowledge on the topic increased.

Fast forward to present day and I have a higher net worth then the average median retiree and I'm only in my mid 30s. 

Thanks to #Bitcoin and the grace of God, I not only have my life back on track, but I'm looking at retiring a couple decades early which will allow me to pursue my true passions.

If you made it this far, I appreciate your time and hope this can inspire even one person who feels like their situation is hopeless.

Getting yourself out of a deep hole when the odds are stacked against you isn't easy, but nothing is impossible and it gets easier with each passing day.

I wish you all the best of luck in your own individual journeys through life.
Keep stacking Bitcoin and with time, you will be rewarded.

what is money? 

why invest at all at various ages?  What are you afraid of at 22 that you might put 20% of earnings into cryptocurrency (or blockchain math/tech/theory… some seem to trade fiat for btc on pure faith)?   

what is the confidence of a 55 year old married person with kids who maybe doesn’t live paycheck to paycheck, but does feel trapped from a class/financial mobility perspective … what is it that convinces someone like that to spend money they could set at a steady few % positive unrealized gains.. at least fight inflation, which is frankly better than most (americans, and i have no idea how it’s thought of in other countries, and would love to know more)?

 Bitcoin will be mined for what 2140 or i forget, but then it’s done… the great big experiment of creating something truly finite will be complete and it can now be a Constant in endless financial multi variable situations.  yay.. I’ll be dead.. you?   

What’s the risk.. uh, (stay with me) “LegitCoin”… which is invented in hypothetical future 2029 …  and is superior or marketed enough like Mcdonald’s to Burger King that Bitcoin isn’t the darling, it’s a player in a blockchain oligarchy?  Do I have to have the intuition to make that investment jump to stay ahead?  

Look at social media… easily apples to oranges here, but I personally did not expect the way social media and frankly the internet has panned out.  …

in 1998, you just didn’t think about how adults and those in legislative, and financial power would wield the internet.   The president didn’t hop on AOL chatrooms and ASL? He didn’t have a very socially competitive top 8 on MySpace (would be interested to know if Tom is invested in BTC lol), and he certainly didn’t release presidential information via flash email invite.  Anyway, get what I mean?   

We have no idea where things will bend in 20 years… the |-|4x0rz internet turned into ‘download the Capital One App and support x cause we calculated is best for us, and let us follow your every move’. 



All that stoned ranting is to say…. how is ‘too the moon’ possible.   If it becomes a bigger thing, those in power will amass the most and find ways to extract it from those with no power.   

mix that in with the many global issues at hand (climate, population,resources, AI, medical tech (150 yo gen x would no surprise me), the creation and manipulation of pop culture (control of global media). 


you think a bunch of people with middle class lives are one day going to just get launched to the moon? sounds about as much of a leap as belief in being saved from the rapture.  Those with exponentially more money and power than us will find a way to take it.  things are all proxy and drink your milkshake style warfare and business.. it will be a long time before violence because you just won’t know it until very late.  


that being said, I own bitcoin, and that’s after being burned in the beginning.   i don’t have a lot, i don’t know as much as i should.   I don’t DCA, I set waterfall limits after a 2-3% drop, but once it becomes btc, i consider it btc .. no back to cash.  

I think for age,  tho I think maybe it may becomes the new ‘credits’ that the future uses… I won’t be around, and kids .. well I have no clue…. I used think all your base are belong to us.  "

And, to the surprise of no one, we **hit an all-time high in the global M2**, ending the period of monetary contraction and starting up the money printers again.

The main component in global M2 is not the US FED, but the China central Bank, which is responsible **for approximately 45% of the world’s money supply**. And China has recently starting to implement several measures to accelerate its base money expansion, not yet shown in the charts:

We all know what happens with monetary expansions: the value of each unit of money in circulation drops, i.e., the price of everything increases. In terms of assets, we know that **Bitcoin is the fastest horse** in the race. As an illustration, please take a look at the following chart showing the year-over-year percentage change in global M2 and the price of Bitcoin. You can see that they have a high correlation.

Do you favor that process for any amount, or do you use different methods depending on the value of the transaction? Can your process be used from anywhere including the United States? "

Long-time Trezor user here, but recently I had a revelation that might save some of you Android users in the UK a headache.
The Challenge:  Picked up a Jade for my brother, but Green Wallet (a popular choice) isn't available for Android in the UK (come on, Green!). Needed a way to track his address balances.
The ""Aha!"" Moment:  Spent a whole day testing various third-party apps, only to realize... ‍♂️  I've been using Trezor Suite Lite for two years and it already does exactly what I need!
The Power of Open Source:  This is why I love open-source platforms like Trezor Suite. It seamlessly integrates with your hardware wallet, regardless of brand. Trezor Suite Lite generates new receive addresses, tracks balances perfectly, and works flawlessly on Android (including the UK!).
Sharing is Caring:  Hopefully this saves someone else the trouble I went through. No need for fancy third-party apps when you have this hidden gem in your back pocket (or rather, on your phone).
Spread the Bitcoin Love!
P.S.: If Trezor is reading this, the app blanks out when we open the phone as its a Samsung fold phone. Maybe there is a update needed for that model!"

I've been using various ""What If I Bought Bitcoin"" calculators and compound interest websites, but I found that many of them weren't as flexible as I needed. I wanted a tool that allowed me to:

* **Specify custom date ranges**
* **Input different amounts on different dates**
* **Simulate regular purchases with varying frequencies and amounts**

So, I decided to create a simple website to address these needs: [BTC ""What If"" Calculator](https://btc-what-if-calculator.vercel.app/)

**What Does It Do?**

* **Single Purchase Simulation**: Calculate potential profit or loss from a one-time Bitcoin purchase over any date range you choose.
* **Historical Analysis**: Analyze Bitcoin's historical performance over custom time periods with interactive charts.
* **Regular Purchases Simulation**: Simulate recurring Bitcoin investments (daily, weekly, or monthly) with customizable amounts and frequencies, even handling semi-complex compound interest scenarios.

**Why I Built It**

I wanted something straightforward yet flexible. The existing tools didn't allow me to input different amounts on different dates or customize the frequency of regular purchases. This calculator aims to keep things simple while providing the flexibility to model various investment scenarios.

**Open Source**

The project is open source! You can check out the code, suggest improvements, or contribute here: [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Publicker/btc-what-if-calculator)

Feel free to give it a try, and I'd love to hear your feedback or suggestions. Whether you're a seasoned investor or just curious about potential Bitcoin investment outcomes, I hope you find this tool useful.

Thanks!"

Sounds great right.

Well...
On maturity after a year the interest goes back to a standard account.

After the year the interest gained is a measley £100. Compared to a DCA in Bitcoin would be a gain of £800 over the same time period.

These numbers aren't exact and over just a year Bitcoin might not perform as well as 8% even, but I think it still goes to show savings accounts are pretty useless.

What would you do with the savings going forward? All in Bitcoin or keep as emergency funds.  "
288,Bitcoin Under Siege: Let's Turn Uptober Into the Ultimate Short Squeeze! 🚀🔥,0,1fv618q,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1fv618q/bitcoin_under_siege_lets_turn_uptober_into_the/,39,2024-10-03 17:32:27,"Hey fam,

I hope you're all doing well. I've been keeping a close eye on Bitcoin as we step into October—**Uptober**, as we like to call it for its history of bullish runs. But something feels off this time. Instead of the usual upward momentum, we're seeing a dip that's got a lot of people scratching their heads. It's only day three, and I couldn't help but wonder: what's really going on here?

**The Hidden Hands at Play**

After digging deeper, it seems that some major players—let's call them the ""big shorts""—are pulling strings behind the scenes. They're heavily shorting Bitcoin, placing massive sell orders to drive the price down. The goal? To instill fear and uncertainty among retail investors like us, hoping we'll panic and sell off our holdings.

**Why Would They Do This?**

Bitcoin isn't just another asset; it's a movement toward decentralized finance that challenges traditional financial institutions. These big shorts thrive in the old system—a system where they hold the power. 

By suppressing Bitcoin's price, they're hoping we'll panic, sell off, and let them scoop up more at a discount. Classic move, right?

**But We've Got Memes and Dreams**

We're not just investors; we're a community. And if there's one thing that unites us, it's our love for memes and a good underdog story.

* **Reclaiming Uptober**: Let's turn this month around and make Uptober live up to its name! 
* **Diamond Hands Unite**: We've held strong before, and we can do it again. 💎👐
* **Whale Watching**: Keep an eye on those big fish, but don't let them dictate our moves. 

**The Fundamentals Are Stronger Than Ever**

The fundamentals of Bitcoin are still rock solid:

* **Growing Adoption**: More people and businesses are embracing Bitcoin every day.
* **Limited Supply**: Only 21 million will ever exist, and some are already lost forever.
* **Strong Network**: The technology behind Bitcoin is as secure and robust as ever.

Nothing has fundamentally changed to justify a price drop. If anything, this could be a setup for a strong rebound.

**What Can We Do?**

1. **Stay Calm and HODL**: Don't let short-term fluctuations shake your long-term belief.
2. **Buy the Dip (If It Makes Sense for You)**: Not financial advice, but lower prices can be an opportunity.
3. **Spread the Word**: Share the memes, educate newcomers, and keep the community spirit alive.

**The Power of the Short Squeeze**

If we collectively decide not to sell—and even consider buying more—we can put pressure on those short positions. A short squeeze could force the big shorts to buy back Bitcoin at higher prices to cover their positions, driving the price up even further. It's a classic move, and we've seen it work before in other markets.

**This Is About More Than Just Profits**

At its core, this is about standing up against market manipulation and supporting a financial system that empowers individuals. Bitcoin represents financial freedom and innovation. By holding strong, we're not just protecting our investments; we're advocating for a better financial future.

**Let's Write Our Own Uptober Story**

It's only the beginning of the month—we have plenty of time to flip the script. Let's not let a few bearish days define October. Together, we can turn those red candles green and make this month one to remember.

Who's ready to reclaim Uptober and send Bitcoin soaring? 🚀🌕

I am am fully verified on etoro since started depositing.

Day 1, i heard nothing.

Day 2, I received an email saying they require

1: passport ID

2: a video of me talking

3: Schedule a call to confirm telephone verification...

I had the call this morning from some guy from what sounded like India, and the end of call was kind of weird, i thought he was going to say ok the bitcoin is on its way, instead there was just silence and i had to ask, well what's the next step, he said i will recieve an email.

Heres the email:

''Thank you so much for taking my call earlier.

As mentioned via phone call, I have sent your case to our Operations department for further review, and once we\`ll have an update, we will get back to you with a response in a reply to this email thread.

Your cooperation and understanding are highly appreciated, and I wish you a lovely day ahead!

If you need further assistance, please reply to this message or chat live with us during our business hours.

Best regards,''

This feels like a very strange email.... almost like a ''failed verification'' email.

I sent them a follow up stating that i have been verified since day 1 and i've done all the steps they have asked and what does ''further review'' mean?

Has anybody else who has withdrawn from etoro experienced anything like this?

  
UPDATE:

They eventually transfered the bitcoin to the wallet on day 4 which was a BIG RELIEF, now its off their platfrom and in cold storage and i can relax!"

Alright, thank you for asking.

Bitcoin essentially falls into the same commodity class as gold. Similar to gold, it is viewed as a store of value, a hedge against inflation, and a decentralized investment.

However, unlike gold, which you can physically own by holding a gold bar in your hand, Bitcoin is intangible. This means it doesn’t have a physical form. The reason gold has remained the number one form of money for thousands of years is because it doesn't erode easily, and its durability ensures it can withstand environmental wear and tear, retaining its form over millennia. Maybe diamonds are better at this, but they aren't easily divisible and have a whole range of other problems in terms of storing value. Gold is also fairly scarce and requires a lot of energy to be mined, making us unable to inflate the market too easily (yet it still went through major fluctuations, like the gold rush) still, no other material has beaten gold as the ultimate store of value—until the invention of Bitcoin. 

Bitcoin has all the qualities of gold, [except it outperforms gold on literally every measure by a long shot.](https://miro.medium.com/v2/0*KGADAwZD1pktM-rD)

Now, since you might still be wondering what the actual fuck a Bitcoin actually is, since it's intangible and all that, let me give you something to compare it to:

Back during the Dutch Golden Age, many clerks used ledgers. These ledgers were basically books consisting of pages full of transactions made with coins. 

Fast forward to today: the clerks and their ledgers have been fully digitized and automated. Now we have miners and the blockchain. The blockchain is like an old-school physical ledger, except it’s fully digital. Because of how miners work (which is very technical to explain), you now have a fully *decentralized* digital ledger.

The reason why this is so significant is that, unlike the clerks and their ledgers, **you don’t need physical coins anymore!**

On the blockchain, Bitcoin is what’s being transacted, just as coins were being transacted in those old ledgers.

So, Bitcoin can't exist without the blockchain, because Bitcoin solely lives in the transactions on the blockchain. This intangibility gives Bitcoin an unfathomably large advantage in **all** aspects when it comes to being the ultimate store of value, especially when compared to gold.

Keep in mind, gold’s market cap is still valued at 10 to 15 times higher than Bitcoin, and this is only because very old people with a lot of gold are incapable of exploring this new digital asset. The reason Bitcoin is valued 10–15 times less than gold is because:  
A. It’s way too young to be valued at the same level—it's crazy it got this far already, and  
B. A lot of people are *still* unaware of the facts I just shared and are *not* willing to accept them (looking at you, Buffet and Schiff).

Anyway, this was my TED Talk. I hope you all enjoyed it."

The printing press changed this, making the Word of God accessible. This key technology facilitated the Protestant Reformation by spreading new ideas and theological material. One technology shifted centuries of thinking, granting individuals sovereignty, including salvation. Similarly, the internet enabled mass communication, followed by Bitcoin, which introduced absolute scarcity through a decentralized public ledger, disincentivizing violence and theft. On the Bitcoin Standard, prices would decrease over time due to technological advancements. Without money printing, endless wars would cease, and government would truly serve the people, as it did under the gold standard.

Say I bought $1000 worth of bitcoin when it was worth $.25 a bitcoin then every time I doubled my money I took out $1000 and kept my original $1000 invested in bitcoin then as bitcoin goes up in Price again and again and again each time I get to 2000 I take out 1000 and I’m left with 1000.How much money would I have now? Given that bitcoin’s current price is $65,000


Let’s break this down step by step:

1. **Initial Purchase**: 
   - You bought $1,000 worth of Bitcoin when the price was $0.25 per Bitcoin.
   - Number of Bitcoins you own initially = $1,000 / $0.25 = **4,000 Bitcoins**.

2. **Doubling Strategy**: 
   - Every time your investment doubles, you take out $1,000 but leave $1,000 invested.
   - For this, we need to track each time the price of Bitcoin doubles, how many Bitcoins you withdraw, and how many you keep invested.

Let’s walk through the price doubling steps, starting at $0.25 and doubling up to $65,000.

### Step-by-Step Doubling:
- **$0.25 to $0.50**: 
  - Value of 4,000 Bitcoins = $2,000.
  - You take out $1,000 (2,000 Bitcoins remain).
  
- **$0.50 to $1.00**: 
  - Value of 2,000 Bitcoins = $2,000.
  - You take out $1,000 (1,000 Bitcoins remain).
  
- **$1.00 to $2.00**: 
  - Value of 1,000 Bitcoins = $2,000.
  - You take out $1,000 (500 Bitcoins remain).
  
- **$2.00 to $4.00**: 
  - Value of 500 Bitcoins = $2,000.
  - You take out $1,000 (250 Bitcoins remain).
  
- **$4.00 to $8.00**: 
  - Value of 250 Bitcoins = $2,000.
  - You take out $1,000 (125 Bitcoins remain).
  
- **$8.00 to $16.00**: 
  - Value of 125 Bitcoins = $2,000.
  - You take out $1,000 (62.5 Bitcoins remain).
  
- **$16.00 to $32.00**: 
  - Value of 62.5 Bitcoins = $2,000.
  - You take out $1,000 (31.25 Bitcoins remain).
  
- **$32.00 to $64.00**: 
  - Value of 31.25 Bitcoins = $2,000.
  - You take out $1,000 (15.625 Bitcoins remain).
  
- **$64.00 to $128.00**: 
  - Value of 15.625 Bitcoins = $2,000.
  - You take out $1,000 (7.8125 Bitcoins remain).
  
- **$128.00 to $256.00**: 
  - Value of 7.8125 Bitcoins = $2,000.
  - You take out $1,000 (3.90625 Bitcoins remain).
  
- **$256.00 to $512.00**: 
  - Value of 3.90625 Bitcoins = $2,000.
  - You take out $1,000 (1.953125 Bitcoins remain).
  
- **$512.00 to $1,024.00**: 
  - Value of 1.953125 Bitcoins = $2,000.
  - You take out $1,000 (0.9765625 Bitcoins remain).
  
- **$1,024.00 to $2,048.00**: 
  - Value of 0.9765625 Bitcoins = $2,000.
  - You take out $1,000 (0.48828125 Bitcoins remain).
  
- **$2,048.00 to $4,096.00**: 
  - Value of 0.48828125 Bitcoins = $2,000.
  - You take out $1,000 (0.244140625 Bitcoins remain).
  
- **$4,096.00 to $8,192.00**: 
  - Value of 0.244140625 Bitcoins = $2,000.
  - You take out $1,000 (0.1220703125 Bitcoins remain).
  
- **$8,192.00 to $16,384.00**: 
  - Value of 0.1220703125 Bitcoins = $2,000.
  - You take out $1,000 (0.06103515625 Bitcoins remain).
  
- **$16,384.00 to $32,768.00**: 
  - Value of 0.06103515625 Bitcoins = $2,000.
  - You take out $1,000 (0.030517578125 Bitcoins remain).
  
- **$32,768.00 to $65,536.00**: 
  - Value of 0.030517578125 Bitcoins = ~$2,000.
  - You take out $1,000, leaving **0.0152587890625 Bitcoins**.

### Final Calculation:
- Now, at a Bitcoin price of **$65,000**, your remaining **0.0152587890625 Bitcoins** are worth:
  - **0.0152587890625 BTC × $65,000 = $991.82**.

So, after taking out $1,000 repeatedly whenever the value doubled, you would now have about **$991.82 worth of Bitcoin** remaining. However, along the way, you would have already withdrawn **$19,000 in total** (since you took out $1,000 each time your investment doubled).

### Total Money:
- Total withdrawals: **$19,000**.
- Remaining Bitcoin value: **$991.82**.
- **Total = $19,991.82**.


So a great outcome but not life changing.

The software can either be in the hardware wallet (ledger, etc.) or software wallet (hot wallet), but at some point a piece of code is going to require your seed phrase.

If that’s the case, you always have to trust the person who created the software for your wallet. If they have any malicious code your seed can be compromised.

I also enjoy Fountain Podcasts where you receive daily free Sats for listening to mostly BTC/Nostr related content.

Do you know of any more platforms where you can earn some extra sats? I’m not much the survey or game type guy, but if the page is neatly done and it works, I would give it a try.

Looking forward to hear your recommendations! 🧡"

First of all: Not your keys, not your coins - that's clear to me, so please don't start any discussions in this direction. On the subject: I would like to do some lending with some of my BTC and already use Bitstamp with 2% p.a. and Nexo with 4% p.a.. Crypto.com also offers 2-4% p.a. (the latter only up to $3,000) in a 3 month fixed term. Which “trustworthy” (as trustworthy as it is possible to be on this topic) platforms can you recommend that pay at least around 2% p.a.?

But i've seen quite a few people recently saying 0.21 is a great target to set yourself (especially as 1 whole BTC may well be out of reach for many now). 

After my latest DCA (shot out to Strike BTC for an awesome service btw!) I hit 0.42 which is now equally divided on two hardware wallets that will one day go to my kids. My parents helped me a lot in my early 30's with money, such as a deposit on a place to buy and i realised a few years ago that I may well struggle to do the same for my kids, which scared me a bit to be honest. 

I reckon they'll be ok. All hail Satoshi! "

447,Bitcoin helped bring our coffee to a worldwide audience. ,25,1frp1zz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1frp1zz/bitcoin_helped_bring_our_coffee_to_a_worldwide/,1,2024-09-29 03:18:22,"Hi from El Salvador!

For close to two centuries now El Salvador, and basically every other country who exports coffee has exported green (unroasted) coffee. A couple of hundred years ago it was really the only way to do things since coffee stales and if you put it on a boat and ship it across the world by the time it'd reach the final consumer the quality would suffer too much. Nowadays with modern logistics networks it opens a door to doing things differently. 

In my experience a fair amount of people outside of producing countries do not know how coffee is made, but basically you plant the tree (it's a 5-8 ft tall tree depending on the variety), wait about 3-4 years for that first harvest and then process and dry the coffee. Once it's dried it's shipped across the world. Every year after that you get one harvest a year. Then, traditionally, when it reaches its destination is roasted and sold to the public. 

Like banking, coffee right now is RIDDLED with intermediaries:

A grower sells the coffee cherries to a mill, a mill processes them and sells them to an exporter, an exporter sells them to an importer, an importer sells them to a distributor, a distributor sells them to a roaster, who sells them to a retailer, who sells them to you.

So we figured there's got to be a better way so we went peer to peer. We're in El Salvador, we buy coffee from growers we know and pay them exactly what they ask for their coffee, roast it, and ship it directly to you bypassing tons of intermediaries in worldwide markets and finance all paid for in bitcoin (mostly over lightning). 

We can get you coffee directly from our roastery in San Salvador to your door in 3-5 days depending on where you are in the world. This peer-to-peer model has allowed us to offer top-tier specialty coffee at a better price while cutting out unnecessary layers of the supply chain.

If you're attending the Adopting Bitcoin conference this year in San Salvador, I’ll be speaking about our journey. You can also learn more on our blog at [thegoodbeans.com](http://www.thegoodbeans.com/), or ask me anything here. Follow us on X at goodbeansthe or try our coffee for yourself!"

I was researching the implementation of the Blockstream Jade's hardware wallet and first I noticed that they don't use the traditional secure element that other popular wallets use. However, what they came up with as a fully open source solution I find it actually pretty clever on top of all the other benefits (not being able to crack the chip directly; making the security layer decentralized; allowing you to run your own Oracle PIN node etc).

I would really love to hear other opinions about this protection design and Jade's wallet in particular. Any users to share their experience and pros/cons?"

Tickers are USM2 and MYAGM2CNM189N

The only reason CNY can still relatively pegged to USD is China implements strict forex regulation to prevent their fiat from leaving their border. 

Assuming that is true, people in China is much more urgent to buy Bitcoin than the US. Every government will print fiat money as long as they are allowed to. All fiat will rebase to zero just a matter of who being faster.

I've been deep in the bowels of bitcoin history looking at the famous 184 billion bitcoin overflow bug of August 15th, 2010, however I've been struggling to understand/explain the exact timing of what happened in this incident.

According to popular block explorers, block 74637, which I understand is the block before anything went wrong, happened at Sun, 15 Aug 2010 05:02:43 -0600, or timestamp 1281870163. This has been the time present in every block explorer I look at such as these two:

* blockchain.com/explorer/blocks/btc/74637

I understand that bitcoin blocks happen on average once per 10 minutes, so I would expect that the next bitcoin block would be produced at roughly Sun, 15 Aug 2010 05:12:43 -0600 or timestamp 1281870763.

However, Jeff Garzik, when he first makes note of the infamous block 74638, which is the block with the overflow problem, the timestamp that he quotes as being **\*in the problematic block with the overflow bug\*** is 1281891957, which is not until August 15th, 2010 11:05:57 AM MDT - more than 5 hours later. We can see the timestamp clearly here in his post: bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=822.0

I can't explain this 5 hour delay. This isn't the fixed version of block 74638. It's the glitched version that Jeff is reporting as having a problem. Shouldn't the glitched block 74638 have been produced approximately 10 minutes after block 74637? It seems like the entire blockchain is delayed by 5 hours. As I understand it, the problem was integers overflowing, and nothing that should have delayed the blockchain in any way.

Furthermore, I don't see why there should be any 5 hour delay at all in the bitcoin blockchain itself. If there is a serious problem and it's diagnosed within an hour of being reported (as we can see on the BitcoinTalk thread above), and there are code fixes with a soft fork shortly thereafter, don't some miners start mining on the soft fork version of the chain right away? Shouldn't their modified clients reject the glitched version of the chain and those miners should be building their own glitch-free chain together the moment any of them start to mine a non-glitched block? They can start getting the 50 BTC rewards assuming what the mine becomes the new chain. So why should there need to be a 5 hour gap at all, as far as the official block timestamps are concerned?

Thanks and sorry if this specific information is published somewhere but I seriously haven't been able to figure it out yet in several sources I've read so far. Thanks again."

The sobering reality of the recent stimulus.,26,1fqnjow,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1fqnjow/china_is_not_sending_bitcoin_to_the_moon_the/,26,2024-09-27 18:49:50,"https://i.redd.it/60pt1bfyqqqd1.jpeg - this is a headline summary of the recent ""stimulus package"" in China.                

https://www.investors.com/news/china-stocks-baba-cat-fcx-climb-on-more-beijing-stimulus/ - addressing buybacks and cash handouts. You would very likely have to be demonstrably impoverished to qualify for cash stimulus. Like so poor you don't even have a toilet to poop in.                  

>The latest reported China stimulus measures include unspecified ""living allowances,"" cash handouts to the poor ahead of Oct. 1, which marks the 75th anniversary of Communist rule.              

>Additionally, Shanghai's government plans to give out 500 million yuan in consumption vouchers for dining, accommodation, cinema and sporting events, according to the Xinhua news service.               

>Beijing also reportedly plans to recapitalize six big state banks with about $1 trillion in yuan, or $142 billion.                  

**The amount of money being used is just one fifth of the first round of stimulus/bailouts that the major banks on wall street were given back in 2008, when George Bush gave them [700 billion near the end of his second term as president.](https://prnt.sc/nVvbC81LElCc)** Wouldn't you think the amount of cash put in people's hands in China would be far less than that amount?              

Bloomberg announced yesterday that the amount to be printed and handed to people is roughly 22 billion for a country with a population 5 times larger than the United States. Source: https://prnt.sc/Op62CzyyADwx - I would link to to the Bloomberg article in question if it didn't have a paywall set to it.                 

By comparison, Americans got 814 billion USD in stimulus payments to their bank accounts (source: https://prnt.sc/7jkIUHEv6pjM). please note: I'm under the impression that since it was 476 million payments, this number assumes total money printed and gifted to Americans in both rounds of stimulus in America,  If we assume that this figure includes the 2000 they got later, then this would mean that approximately 40% of that figure (or in other words almost 326 billion) was given to Americans when the pandemic first hit.

So, how does this help the average Chinese bitcoiner? Very little. At best, the most ""helpful"" part of the stimulus is the cut to mortgage rates because that decreases the amount of money a Chinese consumer has to spend to service a bank loan taken out to buy a house or car. It makes money less tight in a household. In a household where there is loose capital, this *might* help a bit more, but that's it.                

If we were going ""by the book"" with regards to what personal loans can be used for in China, I can post the English regulations from three different banks here, but I'm not going to post an entire steven king novel.                

https://www.icbc-ltd.com/ICBC/EN/PersonalFinance/PersonalLoan/PersonalCreditLoan/                     

https://icbc.com.cn/en/column/1438058389145272639.html              

https://www.boc.cn/en/pbservice/pb2/200806/t20080625_1324001.html                    

The TL;DR for all 3 of these is ""You have to demonstrate that you have a business you are trying to launch / start."" To qualify for a loan you'd need proof that you rented some kind of real estate to house the business (think office space for an office or a ground-floor garage to start a restaurant or bar or something like that), and then the loan that you get helps you pay for things like renovations, buying business-necessary equipment, etc. etc.              

Whereas in America you can get a bank-loan using a new car as collateral and maybe the bank loan cannot be worth more than half of the kelly blue book value of that car (the latter part I'm not sure of, but the first part I am sure of).                

Thanks for coming to my ted talk.               

EDIT: The reason I made this post is because a few weeks ago people were circling around and worshiping a Forbes article and Arthur Hayes stating money printing would go to the people. Most of the ""stimulus"" can be demonstrated this analogy: The U.S. government giving food stamps to a single mom who can barely pay rent while living in partially-subsidized housing. Stimulus does not always mean cash getting handed out to the people. It's not like I have absolutely nothing useful to state about the situation."

I've been deep in the bowels of bitcoin history looking at the famous 184 billion bitcoin overflow bug of August 15th, 2010, however I've been struggling to understand/explain the exact timing of what happened in this incident.



According to popular block explorers, block 74637, which I understand is the block before anything went wrong, happened at Sun, 15 Aug 2010 05:02:43 -0600, or timestamp 1281870163. This has been the time present in every block explorer I look at such as these two: [https://www.blockchain.com/explorer/blocks/btc/74637](https://www.blockchain.com/explorer/blocks/btc/74637) [https://btcscan.org/block/0000000000606865e679308edf079991764d88e8122ca9250aef5386962b6e84](https://btcscan.org/block/0000000000606865e679308edf079991764d88e8122ca9250aef5386962b6e84)

I decided to share my thoughts and beliefs on how I am planning to approach the transition of my business towards a bitcoin future. I highly respect the work of all these great thinkers like, Breedlove, Booth, Bram, Svetski, Giovanni, moss, Saylor etc too many to mention...

so I will add my 2 SATS

Booth's favourite line: prices will fall to the marginal cost of production. If I play this out over a longer time preference I see this ending up in some sort of transition towards a tip economy, continuing on the continuum towards producers actually paying people to use products....maybe I'm reaching too far....(think using mining rig heat for production or LN routing for fees)   

I have a small business that sells a high value physical product year round to a loyal customer base, 20-30 people depending on the time of year. my production is fixed and my operating costs are established. I have no planned large investments needed, and no real competition in my market locally.

my idea is to offer my customers a new payment option to start earning SATS. hear me out. This might backfire but I have to start somewhere. I offer them the product at the price of production(3 month lump payment in fiat to cover running costs and cashflow) and when weekly delivery takes place they ZAP me SATS to the value they ascribe to my product. IE they TIP me.

 product was 100. now 30 and hopefully they tip me 70 in SATS. So I cover my costs and profits are in BTC. If my costs reduce, their cost should also reduce, increasing the perceived value. Value for Value. This is not the ideological bitcoin standard but it is the beginnings of the transition over to it, for my customers to get comfortable with BTC.

Interestingly, as fiat goes off the rails my SATS tips should increase with other Fiat prices (maybe) need to think this through more.

Please find holes in this and let me know if I'm missing anything, hope this help anyone thinking about doing the same. Not twerking...but stacking SATS. You know what I mean.

Ok so the time has come to remove my bitcoin from etoro after receiving an email awhile back saying the may close my account as my investment is in a large negative, this definatly got alarm bells ringing in my head! so now my investment is nearly back evens i want to get off!

Heres my dilemma, im from the UK and the exchange rate is now horrible for me to sell USD and withdraw to GBP, they charge 1% then id have to buy the bitcoin on another exchange for 0.4% which = 1.4%, or i could transfer it to their crypto wallet to 2% fee (the 2% is way less  than what i would lose on the USD - GBP exchange rate)

Only issue is when you request to transfer to crypto they may request further documents and start to 'get funny' (not that i have done anything wrong) Then i will withdraw to a cold wallet

In my mind i feel 2% crypto wallet transfer is best option, what do you think?

  
UPDATE:

I officially requested to withdraw transfer my bitcoin to the wallet on sunday 29th sept (they say it takes 1 - 5 business days) I got an email on Tuesday 2nd Oct stating i need to upload my passport and record a video of myself talking, then also schedule a time for somebody from etoro to give me a call for a phone verification, this happened this morning (3rd oct) I thought that would be the end of it, however i received an email saying they need to do ''further checks'' this is beyond a joke, i have sent them an email stating how my account has been veried since i started depositing and after all this what exactly do you need to check! Do not put your money in etoro they have more security than an airport for getting it out! (Currently still wating on their response)"

The Bisq market is usually a sellers market but today the buyers are running the show.  Feel free to make an offer.

My feeling is that this is because institutions are buying disproportionately more than individuals.  Bisq is an individual market.  If the institutions are pushing up the price and the individuals are not playing along then some individual sellers will push the price down in the Bisq market while the institutions push the price up.

Note: Bisq is also much faster than other exchanges if you want to sell because it only requires a single verifiable bank transfer."

Even block stream Jade website didn’t have a tutorial FAQ for it! 

For those people that have already got a 12 or 24 seed wordlist the passphrase is already blank. What you need to do it before you log onto your hard wallet…

Go to option and select BIP39 passphrase then frequency and once or always depending on you.

Then go back to unlock, and use the green app to unlock your wallet on the phone, it’ll tell you to put your pin in like normal but then tell you to add a passphrase, choose a phrase that you’ll  remember and then it’ll create a new wallet. What I did was write down the 8 digit code on the bottom of the Jade so I could connect it to my various phrases. I created 6 for my kids. I did not use their names

Validation: due to the way HD wallets work (addresses are derived from the master private key) someone cannot connect the two accounts/balances. Correct? 😬"

643,Options on ETFs will result in the god candles we've all been waiting for. Prepare accordingly.,110,1fof0nk,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1fof0nk/options_on_etfs_will_result_in_the_god_candles/,100,2024-09-24 20:47:55,"Market makers will offer options to buy or sell Bitcoin ETFs at a certain price.


The market makers must hedge their positions so they don't get rekt with volatile price action. When someone buys a call option, the market maker will also buy some amount of the ETF and/or BTC to protect themselves from losing a ton of money in an upward swing.



Bitcoin's scarcity will result in spot prices going up because of increased buy demand from the market makers. This turns into a feedback loop called a gamma squeeze, which can result in ridiculous explosions in price.


Of course, the opposite effect can occur on the downside, called a reverse gamma squeeze, or delta unwind. It can result in rapid crashes in price.


But on the whole, as a scarce asset, the upside potential will be far greater.


This is like adding pure rocket fuel. Get ready."
644,Is HodlHodl lending the safest way to get leverage w/o getting rekt?,2,1fp7vf9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1fp7vf9/is_hodlhodl_lending_the_safest_way_to_get/,6,2024-09-25 21:24:34,"Alright, quick one for the Bitcoin heads.

I've been in the game for a minute, but I've only ever played it super safe—buying spot, holding long-term, no leverage.

The thought of getting liquidated because I sneezed wrong while on 10x leverage has kept me far away from exchanges that push that kind of risk.

Most platforms give you 10x minimum, which means a 10% move, and boom—you’re rekt.

So I stayed away.

But now there's HodlHodl, where you can take a loan at 50% LTV (basically like taking 1.5x leverage).

Does any exchange let you do 1.5x?

Plus, there’s interest to consider, but exchanges charge interest on leveraged positions anyway.

This feels like a smarter way to get leverage on your BTC, whether you're going long or short.

So here’s my question: Is HodlHodl actually the safest way to leverage Bitcoin, or am I missing something?

Anyone think there's a better exchange/service out there for going long/short with leverage?

Let’s hear it."

They tend to live with these mistakes until the mistake festers and becomes so painful and unmanageable that eventually correcting it is less painful and disruptive.  

Social media, facebook, instagram, tik tok, etc were all good ideas at a time but the ability to push disinformation and now with A.I. being able to easily deep fake politicians, this idea of having ""everything out there"" I believe will start to become something that humans no longer want.  People will start to quit facebook, no longer read most news, and will instead make strong 'in person' connections with friends and build communities where people actually meet up and talk to each other face to face.  We are still many years away from this happening in a bigger sense, but I already see this happening to my kids - this is suppose to be the generation that absolutely lives in social media, and I'm seeing them start to distance themselves from this world.

I see a very similar trend in money.  We thought fiat was a good idea.  Get off the gold standard (USA), take on debt, and prosper.  This made sense for awhile, with people owning houses that they couldn't affording and buying all kinds of life's pleasures with the ease of the credit card.  This way of looking at money is starting to break and people are now forced to look at inflation, credit, and money printing in a new light.  Again, this is going to take years to truely manifest, but as I speak to adults and definitely kids, they are starting to ask the right questions.  Questions like, why is it OK to just print money we don't have?  Why do people take on credit card debt they'll never be able to afford to pay off?  Why are corporations allowed to buy single family homes and rent them out at market prices?  And why the fuck are we killing good quality full time jobs while corporations are doing billion dollar stock buy backs?

Money is at a breaking point.  It's going to break over the next few years, just like A.I. is going to break everything we know about social media, news, and information.  So I suggest you find some good quality friends and family, make some real connections with people you trust, and buy some fucking bitcoin."

To express 21 billion as a percentage of 10 trillion, follow these steps:

1. **Convert both numbers to the same unit**:
   - 21 billion = \( 21 \times 10^9 \)
   - 10 trillion = \( 10 \times 10^{12} \)

2. **Divide 21 billion by 10 trillion**:

\[
\frac{21 \times 10^9}{10 \times 10^{12}} = \frac{21}{10,000} = 0.0021

3. **Convert the result to a percentage**:

653,Introducing BTC Frame: Your Real-Time Bitcoin Dashboard,16,1fopmmh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1fopmmh/introducing_btc_frame_your_realtime_bitcoin/,20,2024-09-25 04:16:05,"Hey everyone!

I’m excited to introduce you all to something I’ve been working on for a while now—BTC Frame, an elegant smart frame that displays real-time Bitcoin-related information. As a long-time Bitcoin enthusiast, I wanted a simple, hands-free way to track key Bitcoin metrics without constantly checking my phone or computer. That’s how BTC Frame was born!

What is BTC Frame?

BTC Frame is a sleek, plug-and-play digital display that showcases all the essential Bitcoin data you want to keep an eye on—price, difficulty adjustments, next halving countdown, mempool status, and more—all in one place. Think of it as your personal Bitcoin dashboard that updates in real-time without any hassle. The frame connects via WiFi and requires zero technical setup beyond that.

Key Features:

	•	Real-Time Bitcoin Price: Stay up to date with the latest Bitcoin price, sourced directly from trusted exchanges.
	•	Mempool Data: View current transaction congestion and estimated fees.
	•	Difficulty Adjustments: Track the upcoming Bitcoin mining difficulty changes, with a color-coded display—green for positive adjustments and red for negative.
	•	Customizable Display: Choose from different metrics to display based on your preferences.
	•	Easy Setup: It connects via WiFi, and you’re good to go—just plug it in and let BTC Frame take care of the rest.

Why BTC Frame?

I designed BTC Frame for people who want to stay in the loop about Bitcoin but prefer a more ambient, hands-free experience. Whether you’re working from home, in the office, or hosting meetups, BTC Frame provides a beautiful display that can be part of your everyday surroundings. It’s a great conversation starter too, especially for those who are new to Bitcoin and want to learn more.

Free Dashboards for Everyone:

All of the Bitcoin dashboards are freely available at https://btcframe.com. Currently, there are 10 dashboards but I’m constantly adding new data and dashboards to keep it fresh and relevant, so you’ll always have the most up-to-date information!

How It Works:

It runs on a Raspberry Pi and a portable monitor, with the software displaying a web interface in full-screen mode. The best part? It’s all wireless, and you can control it through your local WiFi network.

I’m open to feedback, suggestions, or questions from the community. If you’re looking for a simple way to keep track of Bitcoin without always checking your devices, BTC Frame might be something you’ll enjoy!

Thanks for taking the time to check it out, and I’d love to hear your thoughts."

My paranoid alter ego is inclined to think this is just another opening volley of not so well disguised propaganda in the run up to the elections.

Also how much of the BTC in my account would I be able to be repaid is there s a percentage or are they paying out the full amount?  If my only choice is to take the cash payment as it states will it be anywhere near the current value of BTC?

Lately, a lot of old dormant wallets have been ""waking up"". At first, people kept saying it was someone getting out of prison, but it's happened quite a bit. Here's another example: [https://www.latintimes.com/ancient-bitcoin-whale-reactivates-moves-bitcoin-mined-month-after-btc-launch-560312](https://www.latintimes.com/ancient-bitcoin-whale-reactivates-moves-bitcoin-mined-month-after-btc-launch-560312)

Now I'm not about to insinuate bitcoin got hacked - I'm sure it hasn't. However, it's very possible that someone has managed to find a exploit for an old type of software or hardware wallet. 

It is possible for someone to attack Bitcoin wallets if the key was generated in a vulnerable way. See: [https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/news/366559456/Cryptocurrency-wallets-might-be-vulnerable-to-Randstorm-flaw](https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/news/366559456/Cryptocurrency-wallets-might-be-vulnerable-to-Randstorm-flaw) Note that the vulnerable library in this article is open source - which is often touted as more secure. It usually is, but in this case, people may have been lulled into a false sense of security.

**This could all just be speculation**... or maybe not. If I had a Bitcoin address or wallet that I generated a long time ago, I'd definitely be at least investigating this."

721,Bitcoin option,16,1fnklcm,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1fnklcm/bitcoin_option/,14,2024-09-23 19:05:14,"Information that no one really talks about is the SEC approval of options on BlackRock's Bitcoin ETF (IBIT), which are essentially options on Bitcoin.

What is an option? An option is the right (not the obligation) to buy or sell an asset at a certain price. There are two types - a call option (gives the right to buy), and a put option (gives the right to sell).

For example, Bitcoin is currently at $60,000 and you buy one call option contract for $1,500 that Bitcoin is at $65,000. Therefore, you are buying the right to buy Bitcoin at $65,000 for $60,000. If the price of Bitcoin reaches $65,000, then you are essentially buying Bitcoin for $5,000, and then we subtract the premium (the option price) and get $3,500. Therefore, you made $3,500 on this transaction.

How will this affect the market? First, it gives a new type of investor an opportunity to enter the market, and also provides a hedge for ETF holders, since the underlying asset is Bitcoin. Volatility in the market is everything, and therefore a new opportunity for institutions to take advantage of it.

Second, the new instrument should stimulate large investments in the ETFs themselves, since there will already be a hedge strategy for investors.

For us, retail, the main benefit of having options is increasing exposure to the world of TradFi, and therefore greater recognition and acceptance of the sector as one of the investment areas."

**What is \/r/btc?**

The \/r/btc reddit community was originally created as a community to discuss bitcoin. It quickly gained momentum in August 2015 when the bitcoin block size debate heightened. On the legacy \/r/bitcoin subreddit it was discovered that moderators were heavily censoring discussions that were not inline with their own opinions.

Once realized, the subreddit subscribers began to openly question the censorship [which led to](http://archive.is/0G8az) thousands of redditors being banned from the \/r/bitcoin subreddit. A large number of redditors switched to other subreddits such as /r/bitcoin_uncensored and /r/btc. For a run-down on the history of censorship, please read [A (brief and incomplete) history of censorship in /r/bitcoin by John Blocke](https://medium.com/@johnblocke/a-brief-and-incomplete-history-of-censorship-in-r-bitcoin-c85a290fe43) and [/r/Bitcoin Censorship, Revisted by John Blocke](https://medium.com/@johnblocke/r-bitcoin-censorship-revisited-58d5b1bdcd64). As yet another example, \/r/bitcoin [censored 5,683 posts and comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/noncensored_bitcoin/comments/7414nf/september_2017_stats_post/) just in the month of September 2017 alone. This shows the sheer magnitude of censorship that is happening, which continues to this day. [Read a synopsis of /r/bitcoin](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/6rxw7k/informative_btc_vs_bch_articles/dl8v4lp/) to get the full story and a complete understanding of [why people are so upset](https://www.reddit.com/r/KarmaCourt/comments/5gvqf6/and_now_for_something_completely_different_the/) with \/r/bitcoin's censorship. Further reading can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/83vgdm/a_collection_of_evidence_regarding_bitcoins/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/cpftea/its_important_to_remember_the_past_and_show/ewp7abj/) with a giant collection of information regarding these topics.

-----

**Why is censorship bad for Bitcoin?**

As demonstrated above, censorship has become prevalent in almost all of the major Bitcoin [communication channels](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/5mxov4/wtf_north_koreas_cgc_tries_to_control_bitcoin/dc78hwl/). The [impacts of censorship in Bitcoin](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/5cxx8t/the_impacts_of_censorship/) are very real. ""Censorship can really hinder a society if it is bad enough. Because media is such a large part of people’s lives today and it is the source of basically all information, if the information is not being given in full or truthfully then the society is left uneducated [...] Censorship is probably the number one way to lower people’s right to freedom of speech."" By censoring certain topics and [specific words](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/5vr7ij/partial_list_of_words_that_automod_removes_from/), people in these Bitcoin communication channels are literally being brain washed into thinking a certain way, molding the reader in a way that they desire; this has a lasting impact especially on users who are new to Bitcoin. Censoring in Bitcoin is the direct opposite of what the spirit of Bitcoin is, and should be condemned anytime it occurs. Also, it's important to [think critically](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/5txje0/edward_snowden_the_answer_to_fake_news_is_not/) and [independently](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/9cm3nj/psa_the_sub_has_been_under_attack_by_various_bad/), and have an open mind.

-----

**Why do some groups attempt to discredit \/r/btc?**

This subreddit has become a place to discuss everything Bitcoin-related and even other cryptocurrencies at times when the topics are relevant to the overall ecosystem. Since this subreddit is one of the few places on Reddit where users will not be censored for their opinions and people are allowed to speak freely, truth is often said here without the fear of reprisal from moderators in the form of bans and censorship. Because of this freedom, people and groups who don't want you to hear the truth with do almost anything they can to try to stop you from speaking the truth and try to manipulate readers here. You can see many cited examples of cases where special interest groups have gone out of their way to attack this subreddit and attempt to disrupt and discredit it. [See the examples here.](https://old.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/9cm3nj/psa_the_sub_has_been_under_attack_by_various_bad/)

-----

**What is the goal of \/r/btc?**

This subreddit is a diverse community dedicated to the success of bitcoin. \/r/btc honors the spirit and nature of Bitcoin being a place for open and free discussion about Bitcoin without the interference of moderators. Subscribers at anytime can look at and review the [public moderator logs](https://modlogs.fyi/r/btc). This subreddit does have [rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/wiki/index#wiki_rules_for_this_subreddit_.28also_in_the_sidebar.29) as mandated by reddit that we must follow plus a couple of rules of our own. Make sure to **[read the /r/btc wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/wiki/index)** for more information and resources about this subreddit which includes information such as the benefits of Bitcoin, how to get started with Bitcoin, and more.

-----

**What is Bitcoin?**

Bitcoin is a digital currency, also called a virtual currency, which can be transacted for a low-cost nearly instantly from anywhere in the world. Bitcoin also powers the blockchain, which is a public immutable and decentralized global ledger. Unlike traditional currencies such as dollars, bitcoins are issued and managed without the need for any central authority whatsoever. There is no government, company, or bank in charge of Bitcoin. As such, it is more resistant to wild inflation and corrupt banks. With Bitcoin, you can be your own bank. Read the Bitcoin whitepaper to further understand the schematics of how Bitcoin works.

-----

**What is Bitcoin Cash?**

Bitcoin Cash (ticker symbol: BCH) is an updated version of Bitcoin which solves the scaling problems that have been plaguing Bitcoin Core (ticker symbol: BTC) for years. Bitcoin (BCH) is just a continuation of the Bitcoin project that allows for bigger blocks which will give way to more growth and adoption. You can read more about Bitcoin on [BitcoinCash.org](https://bitcoincash.org/) or read [What is Bitcoin Cash](https://www.bitcoin.com/info/what-is-bitcoin-cash) for additional details.

-----

**How do I buy Bitcoin?**

You can buy Bitcoin on an exchange or with a brokerage. If you're looking to buy, you can [buy Bitcoin with your credit card](https://buy.bitcoin.com/) to get started quickly and safely. There are several others places to buy Bitcoin too; please check the sidebar under brokers, exchanges, and trading for other go-to service providers to begin buying and trading Bitcoin. Make sure to [do your homework first](https://www.bitcoin.com/get-started/how-to-choose-the-right-bitcoin-exchange/) before choosing an exchange to ensure you are choosing the right one for you.

-----

**How do I store my Bitcoin securely?**

After the initial step of buying your first Bitcoin, you will need a Bitcoin wallet to secure your Bitcoin. Knowing which Bitcoin wallet to choose is the second most important step in becoming a Bitcoin user. Since you are investing funds into Bitcoin, choosing the right Bitcoin wallet for you is a critical step that shouldn’t be taken lightly. [Use this guide to help you choose the right wallet for you](https://www.bitcoin.com/get-started/how-to-choose-the-right-bitcoin-wallet/). Check the sidebar under Bitcoin wallets to get started and find a wallet that you can store your Bitcoin in.

-----

**Why is my transaction taking so long to process?**

Bitcoin transactions typically confirm in ~10 minutes. A confirmation means that the Bitcoin transaction has been verified by the network through the process known as mining. Once a transaction is confirmed, it cannot be reversed or double spent. Transactions are included in blocks.

If you have sent out a Bitcoin transaction and it’s delayed, chances are the [transaction fee](https://bitcoinfees.cash/) you used wasn’t enough to out-compete others causing it to be [backlogged](https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#0,24h). The transaction won’t confirm until it clears the backlog. This typically occurs when using the Bitcoin Core (BTC) blockchain due to poor central planning.

If you are using Bitcoin (BCH), you shouldn't encounter these problems as the block limits have been raised to accommodate a massive amount of volume freeing up space and lowering transaction costs.

-----

**Why does my transaction cost so much, I thought Bitcoin was supposed to be cheap?**

As described above, transaction fees have spiked on the Bitcoin Core (BTC) blockchain mainly due to a limit on transaction space. This has created what is called a fee market, which has primarily been a premature artificially induced price increase on transaction fees due to the limited amount of block space available (supply vs. demand). The original plan was for fees to help secure the network when the block reward decreased and eventually stopped, but the plan was not to reach that point until some time in the future, [around the year 2140](https://wiki.bitcoin.com/w/Controlled_supply#Projected_Bitcoins_Long_Term). This original plan was restored with Bitcoin (BCH) where fees are typically less than a single penny per transaction.

-----

**What is the block size limit?**

The original Bitcoin client didn’t have a block size cap, however was limited to 32MB due to the Bitcoin protocol message size constraint. However, in July 2010 Bitcoin’s creator Satoshi Nakamoto introduced a [temporary 1MB limit](https://sourceforge.net/p/bitcoin/code/103/tree//trunk/main.h?diff=515630145fcbc978e39dbaa5:102) as an anti-DDoS measure. The temporary measure from Satoshi Nakamoto was made clear three months later when Satoshi said the block size limit can be [increased again by phasing it in](https://archive.is/L5yvP#selection-3315.0-3315.7) when it’s needed (when the demand arises). When introducing Bitcoin on the cryptography mailing list in 2008, Satoshi said that [scaling to Visa levels](https://www.mail-archive.com/cryptography%40metzdowd.com/msg09964.html) “would probably not seem like a big deal.”

-----

**What is the block size debate all about anyways?**

The block size debate boils down to different sets of users who are trying to come to consensus on the best way to scale Bitcoin for growth and success. Scaling Bitcoin has actually been a topic of discussion since Bitcoin was first released in 2008; for example you can read how Satoshi Nakamoto was [asked about scaling here](https://www.mail-archive.com/cryptography%40metzdowd.com/msg09964.html) and how he thought at the time it would be addressed. Fortunately Bitcoin has seen tremendous growth and by the year 2013, scaling Bitcoin had became a hot topic. For a run down on the history of scaling and how we got to where we are today, see the [Block size limit debate history lesson post](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/61mxuj/block_size_limit_debate_history_lesson/).

-----

**What is a hard fork?**

A hard fork is when a block is broadcast under a new and different set of protocol rules which is accepted by nodes that have upgraded to support the new protocol. In this case, Bitcoin diverges from a single blockchain to two separate blockchains (a majority chain and a minority chain).

-----

**What is a soft fork?**

A soft fork is when a block is broadcast under a new and different set of protocol rules, but the difference is that nodes don’t realize the rules have changed, and continue to accept blocks created by the newer nodes. Some argue that [soft forks are bad](https://medium.com/@octskyward/on-consensus-and-forks-c6a050c792e7) because they trick old-unupdated nodes into believing transactions are valid, when they may not actually be valid. This can also be defined as coercion, as [explained by Vitalik Buterin](https://vitalik.ca/general/2017/03/14/forks_and_markets.html).

-----

**Doesn't it hurt decentralization if we increase the block size?**

Some argue that by lifting the limit on transaction space, that the cost of validating transactions on individual nodes will increase to the point where people will not be able to run nodes individually, giving way to centralization. This is a false dilemma because at this time there is no proven metric to quantify decentralization; although it has been shown that the [current level of decentralization will remain](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/5fyve1/fallacy_the_key_to_bitcoins_decentralization_is_a/) with or without a block size increase. It's a logical fallacy to believe that decentralization only exists when you have people all over the world running full nodes. The reality is that only people with the income to sustain running a full node (even at 1MB) will be doing it. So whether it's 1MB, 2MB, or 32MB, the costs of doing business is negligible for the people who can already do it. If the block size limit is removed, this will also allow for more users worldwide to use and transact introducing the likelihood of having more individual node operators. [Decentralization is not a metric, it's a tool or direction](https://twitter.com/lopp/status/693537120351293440). This is a good video describing the direction of [how decentralization should look](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S1IqaSLrq8).

Additionally, the effects of increasing the block capacity beyond 1MB [has been studied](https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/cornell-study-recommends-4mb-blocksize-bitcoin/) with results showing that up to 4MB is safe and will not hurt decentralization ([Cornell paper, PDF](http://fc16.ifca.ai/bitcoin/papers/CDE+16.pdf)). Other papers also show that no block size limit is safe ([Peter Rizun, PDF](https://www.bitcoinunlimited.info/resources/feemarket.pdf)). Lastly, through an informal survey among all top Bitcoin miners, many agreed that a block size increase [between 2-4MB is acceptable](http://archive.is/U3dqr).

Peter Todd is not Satoshi, he's done plenty of things over time which were against the interests of Bitcoiners (*), and he sure as hell hath no cryptographic proof of being Satoshi.

- ... RBF (basically destroying the cash-like nature and a central property of Bitcoin -- the irreversability of transactions -- mentioned in the whitepaper),
- ... proposing supply inflation as a means to solve the coming network security issue due to BTC's crippled blocksize, 
- ... supporting the crippling of the blocksize in the first place (i.e. going directly against Satoshi's advice to increase the blocksize once blocks became full in 2016),
- ... working with a claimed USG agent to propagandize against bigger blocks,
- ... supporting the LN non-solution which everyone with a brain told them would not be able to scale in the right way (it can't on a 7 tps base layer - that's even documented in the LN whitepaper lol),

Bitwise (BATS:BITB) wasn’t left out either, attracting $13.09 million, while Ark Invest and 21Shares (BATS:ARKB) teamed up for $12.63 million in fresh cash. 🤑🔥

VanEck (BATS:HODL) and Invesco (BATS:BTCO) also got their slice of the pie, adding $5.37 million and $2.53 million, respectively. 🍰 Meanwhile, Grayscale (OTC:GBTC) and six other ETFs… well, they reported zero inflows. Oops! 😅

Despite all the drama, the total trading volume for these ETFs hit $1.22 billion, showing that the market is heating up again! 🔥💥

Ethereum, Where You At? 🤨

While Bitcoin ETFs were having a field day, Ethereum ETFs took a breather, reporting no inflows on Monday. It’s like they decided to take a vacation! 😎🌴 This came after mixed results last week, where Ethereum struggled to keep the momentum going.

Bitcoin Price Dip 📉

Even with all this activity, Bitcoin’s price dipped 1.4% to $62,457, while Ethereum also dropped 1.3% to $2,442. Ouch! 😬💔 But hey, it’s crypto—ups and downs are all part of the game! 🎢

Why Does It Matter? 💡

Here’s where things get juicy! On Monday, MicroStrategy (NASDAQ:MSTR) reached a six-month high, even while Bitcoin’s price was wrestling with a key moving average. It’s like MicroStrategy just decided to party on its own! 🎉💼

At the same time, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq both took a hit, dropping by more than 1% in the afternoon. 📉 And just when we thought things couldn’t get crazier, the Volatility Index (VIX) spiked by 19%, hitting its highest point in a month. 😱

Analysts Speak Out 🎤

The folks at QCP Capital said that Bitcoin’s “Uptober” is back on track, driven by macroeconomic factors keeping Bitcoin above the $60,000 level. 🎯 But don’t get too comfortable! They warned that Thursday’s CPI report will be a key moment that could swing Bitcoin’s price either way. ⚠️

What’s Next? 👀

Everyone’s eyes are now on Thursday’s CPI report, which could determine whether Bitcoin keeps rising or faces more turbulence. Will “Uptober” continue, or are we in for a bumpy ride? 🚀📉 Stay tuned to find out!

An overview of how it works first. On BTC, miners work to create blocks using a proof of work.

The miners keep each other in check so that if some tiny miner decides to produce bad blocks, the rest of the network will just ignore the rogue miner.

The trouble is that when the majority of the network becomes rogue, and you can have a 51% attack.

**What could a 51% attack look like?**

Imagine that you sell your motorbike and receive some coins in exchange. You check the blockchain, coins received, and all is well.

As soon as the buyer is gone with your bike, you check the blockchain again, and oops! Your coin is gone!

80% of the miners decided to collude, re-mine the latest blocks, remove the transaction where you received the coins, and replace that with a bribe from the motorbike thief.

You are left there, bamboozled, with no bike and no coin...

This attack would be catastrophic for the network and erode the trust people place in it. It is fortunately  hard to pull off because you need a majority of the hashrate for that.

You could buy 10 million USD or 20 million USD of equipment to mine, but that still wouldn't get you to 51% of the BTC hash rate.

Of course, if you had unlimited resources like a magician, you could print out mining rigs like there is no tomorrow and then overtake the network. But you are not that rich.

So, it's the economic cost of overtaking the network that protects it from the collusion of bad miners.

It would be so much cheaper and simpler for bad actors to attack if more and more miners just stopped mining!

**Why do the miners keep mining anyway?**

For the money! They buy cheap equipment, use cheap energy to produce blocks, and receive mining rewards. With the rewards, they pay back the equipment and the energy and then keep a profit.

As long as this business is profitable, the hashrate of the miners stays the same or increases.

What happens when the block reward is reduced?

Nothing at first, but if it is reduced too much, the reward is no longer enough to cover the energy and equipment costs, and then the miners start shutting down some of their units.

They are not in it for the tech; remember, they want to make money. They will shut down mining rigs unless the price of the coin has increased and the new price is enough to cover their costs.

On BTC, every 4 years, the block reward is divided by 2. If the price of BTC stays the same during that time, it means that mining brings half as much revenue every 4 years, so it's rapidly going to zero.

For example, if the miners are at break-even in a given year, 4 years later they will receive half as much money for their work, so they will have a 50% loss.

If somehow the price of BTC managed to double by that time, the miners would be back at break-even, but they might fear what will happen after 4 more years.

As the block reward keeps dropping and there are not nearly enough transaction fees to compensate, the BTC hashrate is going to drop more and more, and at some point the bad actors will be able to pull off their motorbike heist.

This was my understanding of the troubles of the BTC security model until very recently.

That is, until I read **""Highjacking Bitcoin"" by Roger Ver**.

The book explains how bitcoin was captured by the bitcoin core developers and their company, Blockstream. It's an interesting read, and I highly suggest you give it a look.

**Why does it matter?**

My understanding of the book is that now that Blockstream controls the code of the project, the main discussion spaces of its community,  the BTC ticker, the 'Bitcoin' brand, and it is no longer challenged as to how to update the BTC protocol.

They have effectively become the masters of BTC.

They can steer it how they see fit. Roger gives the example of the Liquid Network as their proprietary alternative to the troubled bitcoin network.

This centralization of power could be very 'useful' if the miners have a problem (the mining rewards are too low) or if the miners ever become a problem.

During the civil war, the miners had the power to choose the new King. At that time, everyone agreed that bitcoin was the chain with the most POW, starting from the genesis block of Satoshi.

If Bitcoin Cash had been able to divert enough miners to it, it would have won the BTC ticker and the Bitcoin brand. Bitcoin Cash didn't win, and nowadays, the consensus is changing to ""Bitcoin is what the Bitcoin core developers are working on"".

The subtle difference is that if there is a problem, the core developers could decide to update the protocol and sideline the miners that don't fit their vision.

What happens if the block reward and transaction fees are systemically too low for too long?

Let's imagine a scenario where the number of miners decreases and the hashrate fluctuates violently. The core developers then decide to protect the network by updating the protocol rules so that only serious miners can continue mining.

The result would be that only the ones aligned with the core developers will remain.

This is drastically different from a few years ago, where the miners were still the kingmakers.

**How does this change the security model of BTC?**

BTC now has a king, and its name is Blockstream.

The king does not want to die, and it will take actions to avoid that.

BlockStream will never let the miners close shop en masse if it endangers the whole network they control.

The network will survive, with or without miners, because it's the foundation of the power of the king.

Granted, for me and you peasants and humble farmers, getting value out of it will probably involve a fair bit of grovelling, frantic begging and pleading for mercy to our new overlords,

but hey! The Number will Go Up!

PS: I would love to get opinions on the topic. What do you think of Roger's book?

Bitcoin having been created and maintained as a protocol built on open source, is capable of slipping attempts to grasp control of it through the forkability of its components.

There can be competing ""Bitcoins"" - protocols deriving from the common ancestor.

They may be known under distinct names and tickers, such as 'Bitcoin Cash' (BCH) in order to provide the market with more information about themselves.

To provide continued resilience against capture, they continue being open source protocols, free to anyone to use and modify.

Soundness of the original money (Bitcoin) is not harmed in general by currency splits which preserve holder equity.

Bitcoin Cash coordinates upgrades without a central authority using the CHIP process (e.g. [CashTokens](https://github.com/cashtokens/cashtokens/blob/master/stakeholders.md), [ABLA](https://gitlab.com/0353F40E/ebaa/-/blob/main/stakeholders.md)).

For the May 2025 Upgrade, I proposed two CHIPs for November 15th lock-in: [Targeted Virtual Machine Limits (Limits)](https://github.com/bitjson/bch-vm-limits) and [High-Precision Arithmetic for Bitcoin Cash (BigInt)](https://github.com/bitjson/bch-bigint).

The upgrade is in ~8 months, lock in is 50 days away. We're asking for reviews and feedback from all Bitcoin Cash users, businesses, and developers.

Ask Me Anything!

---

The Limits and BigInt CHIPs would allow developers to do **far more with Bitcoin Cash contracts**:

- **Simpler, easy-to-audit math** – reducing transaction sizes, like the [Jedex](https://blog.bitjson.com/jedex-decentralized-exchanges-on-bitcoin-cash/) market maker contract, by hundreds of bytes. With this upgrade, contracts like these could use fewer bytes than single-signature addresses, as is [already possible with other contracts](https://x.com/bitjson/status/1542578383720271873). A number of BCH DeFi projects (e.g. Jedex) are currently tied down by the cost and complexity of carefully implementing and auditing specific emulations of high-precision math. Worse, contracts which successfully clear this development obstacle, ultimately waste bandwidth, block space, and node CPU utilization when compared to this upgrade's native math.
- **Larger stack items** – clearing the way for post-quantum cryptography, stronger escrow strategies, zero-knowledge proofs, and other important developments for the future security and competitiveness of Bitcoin Cash.
- **More than 201 opcodes** – While the CashTokens upgrade makes it technically possible to break contracts up into multiple parts, the somewhat arbitrary 201 opcode limit ([established by an emergency patch in 2010](https://gitlab.com/bitcoin-cash-node/bitcoin-cash-node/-/commit/757f0769d8360ea043f469f3a35f6ec204740446)) raises the cost of developing and deploying many contracts, forcing contract authors to remove important features or complicate otherwise simple contracts with a harder-to-audit, ""multi-input state machine"". This increases the cost of development and safety audits, and in some cases, it causes teams to abandon valuable product ideas.

___
How deep is the integration of anonymity networks like Tor and I2P in general.

My take is that the BCH community is largely ignoring or hand waving privacy risks, always pointing to CashFusion which reliably only works in one wallet (Electron Cash). It pains me to say this, but the state of privacy within BCH is miserable.

Who is willing to change this? Monero has great success funding its infrastructure through CCS and bounties. BCH has Flipstarter but it is rarely used for infrastructure projects or fixing bugs/privacy issues. The one infrastructure project that comes to my mind ""BCH<>XMR atomic swaps"" is taking ages? Is it abandoned? https://atomic-flip.pat.mn/en"

Can I just buy a ton of bitcoin in like Binance and then take the money out in USA? Will it be considered legal money?

There is no way of bank to bank transfer from MM to USA since Myanmar Military Junta are short on dollars and have put lots of restrictions.

Of course, under such a negative light and context, crypto was bashed harshly in this thread. In my quesitonable wisdom, I chose to step in and defend crypto, try and get people to not further hate an entire form of currency due to the actions of one.

I didn't expect to be received positively, but the response was worse than I thought:

[First comment thread](https://i.imgur.com/mFkkaz1.png), here r/touhou mods are actively promoting that people be bullied because they like crypto.

[Continued](https://i.imgur.com/IFD4m8T.png), here I get told I have ""malicious rethoric"" and I am ""lambasting a country"" for saying Russia is doing a bad thing for starting a war, wtf?

[Second comment thread](https://i.imgur.com/IFD4m8T.png), here my comment got reported and removed for being ""spam"". So, people can talk negative things about crypto in this thread, but the first good thing about crypto is spam?

[Third comment](https://i.imgur.com/EHsb2L8.png), I did not even reply to this one, but this is probably the worst offender. r/touhou mods are just openly and casually advocating for murder. What the actual fuck?

Please tell me if I'm being stupid or the asshole, or if this is genuine and blatant mod abuse, and if so where can I report this?"

They are the new best models according to most comparisons, but come with a price tag to match.

**DeepSeek V2.5** is now available for API users, as are **Dolphin Mixtral 7x8b** and **Dolphin Mixtral 7x22b,** while the Gemini models for everyone were updated to the newest version as soon as this was possible.

We've also added redundancy. **Most models now have fallbacks** with other providers meaning models being unavailable should practically never happen anymore.

Other models that we've added, to the API only for now, are **Llama 3.1 8b decentralized** and **Llama 3.1 405b decentralized**. These are decentralized versions of Llama Small (which we don't show by default) and Llama Large (which is on our website). We've added these because we're always trying to improve and decentralized open source models *could* offer even better privacy and robustness.

The reason these are only on API for now is we're unsure just how well they work yet, so what we've done is made the prices for them extremely low and let people test it through API. If we see everything working well and get good feedback on them we might make them available in the dropdown menu soon. The dropdown menu is getting a bit oversized with all the options we have though, so we have to make choices there.

Last but not least we've added a **""free model"" option.** These models are not the best models but allow people to try out our service for free and work for simple questions. If people want better performance and use the state-of-the-art models they can always deposit a few cents to try that out, and see how they go!

As always thanks for the support and feedback, it's a rush every time someone reaches out to tell us they're getting value from our service or cares enough to give feedback. Those building stuff probably know there's no better feeling, so thanks."

	The global economy is facing rifts comparable to the pressures that resulted in “economic nationalism” and a collapse in global trade in the 1920s and ultimately the Great Depression, the president of the European Central Bank has warned.

“We have faced the worst pandemic since the 1920s, the worst conflict in Europe since the 1940s and the worst energy shock since the 1970s,” said Christine Lagarde on Friday, adding that these disruptions combined with factors such as supply chain problems had permanently changed global economic activity"

i.e. from 0 to 1000, and it creates an empty 32-bit string that is filled with zeros.

Then, it generates the public key of the respective private keys and checks for its balance on the blockchain.

I got hundreds of account with transactions like that, ranging from 0.0001 BTC up to 0.4 BTC in the early beginnings of Bitcoin and I was able to import those WIF private key accounts into Electron Cash and get a look at the transactions list and have full access to those wallets that the early Bitcoin developers created.

I get the wallets in the following format:

Private Key (WIF): XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

Public Key: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

Bitcoin Address: 1DBaumZxUkM4qMQRt2LVWyFJq5kDtSZQot

Number of transactions: 4

Total received (in satoshis): 1200961

Total sent (in satoshis): 1200961

Final balance (in satoshis): 0

unfortunately, though, it seems that other developers have looked into this after so up until now I wasn't able to find any with an interesting amount, but the transaction lists that span from the beginning of bitcoin's popularization are nice to see. When you give a private key that has all 666666, you would be able to see that it has a transfer with the amount of 666 satoshi or i.e. a priv key that has 1111 numbers with 1234 satoshi transfered in it

The site is popxdex.com
After you make an account with just a random email and password, there is a small field that lets you in on a random referral program.
Two working “vaucher” codes i have found are “B27”
“B28”
And they add up to around 0.55 btc

Now, you can actually go and try to withdraw it to a wallet you own but the catch seems to be that you need to be verified in order to withdraw and the only way to verify yourself is to deposit 300£ / 300USD

Now, obviously I haven’t verified myself, but it stays on my mind that there’s a 0.001% chance i might get lucky, lol
Anyone got info on this?

I’m more Bullish 🐂 now probably more than ever before! 
I’m not saying bitcoin is not volatile but it’s been pretty sideways  after this last halfing. Who expected that? Before the last halfing  all the charts I seen was straight to the moon 100 or more.. i’m not saying we’re not gonna reach that point, but it seems like it’s a lot slower than those charts expected? I am in no rush. When I first purchased bitcoin 2014 I had a big window opportunity five years… lol Here it is almost 11 years later and I’m still holding the same original coins! I’ve been buying on the dips, of course whenever I can buying and buying and buying more! 

What I’m trying to figure out next is how to use what I own as leverage to buy more? 

Anyways, that’s enough for now. Here’s to the future guys and thank you very much! "

[Link to previous update about BigInt CHIP](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/1f812r8/updates_to_chip202407bigint_highprecision/)

Since then:

- GP have engaged in review process about both [(VM limits comment)](https://bitcoincashresearch.org/t/chip-2021-05-targeted-virtual-machine-limits/437/93) and [(BigInt comment)](https://bitcoincashresearch.org/t/chip-2024-07-bigint-high-precision-arithmetic-for-bitcoin-cash/1356/26) CHIPs.
- Calin & I have created a [property testing suite (WIP)](https://gitlab.com/cculianu/bitcoin-cash-node/-/commits/wip_bca_script_big_int) for math ops. I'm implementing the tests according to a [draft test plan](https://github.com/bitjson/bch-bigint/pull/7/files), and I hope to complete implementing all the tests ASAP.
What is [property testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_testing#Property_testing)? It's how you can test math system as a whole, e.g. we know that (a + b) - b == a must hold no matter what, so we run this script: <a> <b> OP_2DUP OP_ADD OP_SWAP OP_SUB OP_NUMEQUAL and we test it for many random values of a and b (such that a + b <= MAX_INT), and the script must always evaluate to true. So far so good, all the test so far implemented (ADD, SUB, MUL) pass as expected, giving us more confidence in BCHN's BigInt implementation. This is a new testing framework that Bitcoin never had!
- I have added a section to VM limits rationale, hoping to clarify the general approach ([byte density based limits](https://github.com/bitjson/bch-vm-limits/pull/19)): basically input size creates a budget for operations, and then opcodes use it up.
- Jason has changed budgeting from whole TX based to input based ([see rationale](https://github.com/bitjson/bch-vm-limits/blob/master/rationale.md#use-of-input-length-based-densities)). This is the better approach IMO, to keep things nicely compartmentalized."

In addition to the option of creating a fundraising campaign, especially for a poor 3rd world country such as Lebanon, who is facing a severe economic crisis and risk of war and daily bombings amid escalated tensions in the middle east.

The platform will be powered with Stripe to process payment and donations from international users, while on the Lebanese users' end they can payout their money to one of the local money transfer (like Wish or OMT) or even using cryptocurrency"

It's something you'd *HODL* and wait on. But we are witnessing what I'd call the **BTCfi revolution**. 

We can do so much more with **Bitcoin**, yield farming, staking, bridging, lending and **Bitcoin** happens to be a pretty underrated collateral. We can actually unleash creativity and not just look at **Bitcoin** as *digital gold*.

I must have touched a sensitive nerve. I thought people here might have more critical attitudes.

The question is about Coinbase. Personally I wouldn't touch it with a long stick, but it seems like most of the general public buy and sell BTC there. They also have wallets on Coinbase.

But I hear nothing is done on-chain there. So what are the consequences of that?

In the fiat world we know that if 100% of bank account holders asked to withdraw their money, it would be a disaster. Or even 10%. The money doesn't exist.

Analogously what would happen if all Coinbase customers suddenly wanted to retrieve their BTC to private wallets? What percent would succeed before there was just no more Bitcoin to give out? Please estimate. All hypothetical.

If Timmy owns a self-custody bitcoin and Janey owns a Coinbase bitcoin then Timmy could make a case that his Bitcoin is worth more than hers, because Timmy's bitcoin is backed by mathematics whereas hers is backed by the promises of bankers in a sector that is rife with fraud.

I read that Coinbase claims to be ""full-reserve"", but very few people believe it. Customers regularly complain that they are unable to access their funds. The sector as a whole has an even worse record: companies like FTX keep going up in smoke for fraud.

I keep asking if Coinbase and their sellers can print Bitcoin at will. So far nobody has been able to say, ""No, they can't"". 

I don't use Coinbase. Why should I care? Well if they can print Bitcoin at will, it massively devalues my hard-earned Bitcoin. Even though my Bitcoin is on-chain and in self-custody, that doesn't matter if the gullible public are willing to buy a fake Bitcoin for the same value as my real Bitcoin.

The official value of BTC is published by exchanges. This appears to be a mix of the value of real BTC and the value of paper BTC. 10% vs 90% ? Nobody seems to know. Maybe real BTC is already worth ten times more than the published value.

But how can I sell on-chain BTC for its real value? I can see that the value of real BTC could continue to go up if it could be separated from paper BTC. Otherwise there is no reason at all for it to go up. The price will remain stagnant.

Reflection 70b, according to the evaluations, outperforms the other top models in tasks such as:

* language 
* mathematical reasoning 
* logical reasoning 
* reasoning that involves theoretical/ university reasoning questions

It does so at about 1/5th to 1/10th the cost of Claude, Gemini and ChatGPT, so give it a try. 

*Reflection 70B has some odd random text thrown in sometimes which is an error the model creators are aware of. Nothing we can do about it yet unfortunately.*

Since our BCH payment route is by now pretty well-tested and is seeing quite some use **we're raising the limit on it to $20 per payment** (was $10). We still recommend not putting in too much but you do you, you can make your own decisions. Minimum is still just $0.10, to make the barrier to trying it out as low as possible.

**We've also added Gemini Pro Exp.** This is the experimental upgrade version of Gemini Pro. It's smarter in every way, but is technically still ""under evaluation"" by Google and is ""less stable"". Take that as you will. It's a bit cheaper than regular Gemini Pro too.

Talking about cheaper - **we've decreased our prices on Gemini 1.5 Pro & Flash and Llama 3.1 Medium & Large.** It's a 10-40% drop in prices.

Finally, **we now have permanent referral links.** If you like our service and want to refer others to us while making some money on the side, create a referral link. It gives whoever you refer a 5% discount, while you get 10% of the revenue from them. Pre-funded invites (invites that have a balance on them) are still possible as well and give the same 10%/5%.

That's all for now!"

This is thanks to budgeting system introduced in [CHIP-2021-05-vm-limits: Targeted Virtual Machine Limits](https://github.com/bitjson/bch-vm-limits), which caps Script CPU density to always be below the ~~common typical P2PKH transaction~~ 1-of-3 bare multisig transaction.

Interestingly this also **reduces complexity** because no more special treatment of arithmetic ops - they will be limited by the general limit used for all other opcodes.

On top of that, I did some edits, too, hoping to help the CHIP move along. They're [pending review](https://github.com/bitjson/bch-bigint/pulls) by Jason, but you can see the changes in [my working repo](https://github.com/A60AB5450353F40E/bch-bigint).

I have created over 40 videos about Bitcoin Cash and translated several projects, including Electron Cash, Unspent, and Paytaca Wallet. Translating the complete Bitcoin white paper into Hausa has been one of my proudest achievements.

Four months ago, I launched a campaign, but some members of the Bitcoin Cash community suggested that my scope was too broad, so I scaled it back. Unfortunately, even after making adjustments, the campaign was not funded. Despite this, I continued onboarding people and publishing articles. Four months later, I launched the current campaign to continue creating content and onboarding people to Bitcoin Cash. I've run the campaign for a month, and I have raised 1.41 BCH out of 25 BCH, leaving 23.59 BCH to go with just 17 hours left. Now, it’s about to expire.

The gif is doubly applicable - **Hermes 3 Large** is an unfiltered model that Nous Research describes as ""aligning to the user, with powerful steering capabilities and control given to the end user.""

We're temporarily offering it **for free** on our website, which allows anyone to try out our website before having deposited anything, then decide for themselves whether they want to use other, stronger models and image generation. After the free period this unfiltered model will stay, but we'll charge for it normally.

Tying in with the ""try it out for free, then add funds"", [we've added an Earn page to our website.](https://nano-gpt.com/earn) I'm personally very excited about this one, because I'd love to see a more circular ecosystem around crypto. We've primarily added ways to earn Nano in there since those are the ones we know and could find, but want to add ways to earn BCH or any of the currencies we support for direct payments.

***Suggestions on additions to the Earn page are very welcome. If you know a service that would fit well with the Earn page and pays out in BCH (or Nano, or Banano) please let us know.***

We added a [pricing page](https://nano-gpt.com/pricing) to make the costs of the different models clearer. There's an example prompt and output to make it a bit more understandable.

In addition to Hermes 3 Large we've added a few more models:

* Sao10k L3 Euryale 70B
* MythoMax 13B
* WizardLM-2 8x22b

All three of these are available via API only - they're models that are mostly suited for roleplaying and specific purposes. We've added them mostly for specific customers but they're available to everyone if you want.

Finally, we've done some **UX improvements**. Ideally you don't even notice that we've done this, unless you've been very annoyed by for example the large header with conversation title when you were using it on mobile.

Happy prompting! And be sure to check out some of the places to Earn Nano on the Earn page!"

---

Good afternoon!

First, some context for those who don’t know us yet:

[BitcoinVN](https://bitcoinvn.io/about-us) is [Vietnam's oldest Bitcoin exchange, launched in 2014.](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2014/03/23/international-effort-brings-boost-for-bitcoin-in-vietnam/)

Our [primary business is providing a smooth on- and off-ramp service in Vietnam](https://bitcoinvn.io/?deposit=bch&settle=vnd). Over the years, we’ve expanded our services to include direct [crypto-crypto swaps](https://bitcoinvn.io/?deposit=xmr&settle=bch), a [physical Bitcoin ATM network](https://bitcoinvn.io/btm), [hardware wallet supplies](https://bitcoinvn.io/shop) (Vietnam customs can be tricky to deal with), and an [OTC desk for private clients](https://bitcoinvn.io/otc) who wish to transact larger amounts.

One of our core team members is also known as an active contributor & supporter of the BCH ecosystem for many years (IYKYK).

Fwiw: If you’re looking to experiment with our [API,](https://bitcoinvn.io/api/doc) there’s a BCH testnet available, and you’ll likely receive a warm welcome if you’re looking to do something with it. :)

**Context & risks of giving up self-custody**

For our crypto-crypto swap feature on the online exchange, we allow our users to[ ""stake"" (i.e., provide liquidity](https://bitcoinvn.io/staking)) for various coins and earn a share of the exchange volume in return.

This number generates the APR estimates on a dynamic basis—[the more staked, the lower the APR; the more swapped, the higher the APR,](https://bitcoinvn.io/news/how-does-staking-on-bitcoinvn-work/) etc. (Some more detailed explanations of the math were listed in the original thread linked below).

We generally don’t advertise this feature much (and if we do, it’s always with the [appropriate risk disclaimers](https://bitcoinvn.io/news/bitcoinvn-staking-service-hacked/)) because we don’t want people who don’t fully understand the risks to put their capital at risk. 

Even if *we* are honest about it - and our track record might give us the benefit of the doubt - it’s **generally bad practice to give up custody of your coins in exchange for yield**, as time has proven again and again.

This also leads to the situation where we currently have only a few dozen participants in these vaults (""liquidity pools""), hence the APR might be comparatively high at times for some of these coins/tokens.

The reason for these staking vaults is simply to provide liquidity for the online swap exchange - so that if people want to move several thousand $$ from crypto A to crypto B, they can do so without getting stuck due to insufficient balance in the exchange’s hot wallets.

It’s a tool to provide a better service to our user base - not a revenue-generating activity per se.

Of course, happier users (due to faster swaps) will indirectly help us operate a successful business.

**Adjustments implemented to displayed APR numbers**

Recently, there was [a thread in this subreddit that expressed well-justified curiosity and skepticism about a suspiciously high APR number displayed on our BCH staking vault](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/1ctymwu/bitcoinvn_pool_offers_60_interest_for_bch_what_do/).

The 60% mentioned there certainly sounds like a scam at first glance and **should generally be treated as such**.

While the numbers were indeed real *(since then, the APR on BCH has dropped to about 8% as of the time of writing)*, we also understood that the way it was displayed could quickly lead people to the wrong conclusions about ""what is on offer"" here.

While there was nothing in our actual operations that required change, we took the feedback that, for ""outsiders,"" simply seeing one outrageously high APR number listed could provide a highly misleading picture of what is actually going on here.

As such, we now also display the ""FDAPR"" (fully diluted APR) based on what the APR would be if the staking vault (""liquidity pool"") were filled to its maximum capacity.

For example, in the specific case of BCH, the current APR is about 7.6%. However, if the full size of 200 BCH were staked, the APR would only be about 2.2% at the current swap turnover.

These numbers naturally will change daily/hourly... based on how much of the coin is traded vs staked (we will be looking to publish some of the statistical trends soon).

**Last, but not least:**

No, we don’t want you to start staking with the service :)

*(Unless you really, really understand what you’re doing!)*

What we would rather see:

If you live in [Vietnam and/or have bills, salaries, or rent to pay in Vietnam—give us a try](https://bitcoinvn.io/?deposit=bch&settle=vnd) :)

We also allow our users to swap their crypto without a sign-up requirement.

Or you could buy a [T-shirt](https://bitcoinvn.io/shop/product/crusader-pepe-t-shirt/) or some [stickers](https://bitcoinvn.io/shop/product/pepe-crusader-sticker-large/)—to help spread the message:

**Not your keys, not your coins!**

Thank you for your attention - and we are grateful for the feedback received and welcome further opportunities to improve our services.

Not many are a fan of selling off their precious sats. But I am curious as to whether Bitcoiners would ever consider a decentralised exchange for Bitcoin.

Something akin to a Uniswap-like platform where you could swap your Bitcoin and other assets and then back again seamlessly. Is this appealing?

And if such an exchange existed, what would one want it to have? I am on about features, it could be anything from lower fees, security or a simple UI. Or is the idea of swapping BTC for anything else a no-go?

I actually validate the transanction in the code i wrote, using what i assume to be how actual miners validate transactions, and it worked, which is what makes me feel like it is this assumption that is wrong.



The signatures check out and are valid:-

I derive them by removing the script sig from the input in this transaction, replacing it with the script pub key of the output whose transaction has that ID and has the output at the given index, taking the hash if it while it is in the transaction and signing that data.



The code is stiil not completely written so some things might look incomplete, but it runs fine, it can be found here(it needs boost-beast, boost-asio and openssl to compile):- [https://github.com/AbelMarnk/Bitcoin](https://github.com/AbelMarnk/Bitcoin)

- [CHIP-2021-05-vm-limits: Targeted Virtual Machine Limits](https://github.com/bitjson/bch-vm-limits) ([link to discussion on BCR](https://bitcoincashresearch.org/t/chip-2021-05-targeted-virtual-machine-limits/437))

They are focused on smart contract improvements, and they would make it easier for builders to build things like:

- [Zero confirmation escrows](https://github.com/bitjson/bch-zce), to improve 0-conf security
- More efficient and precise AMM contracts
- Quantum-resistant contracts (by using Script to implement Lamport signatures or RSA as a stepping stone)
- SPV proof verification in Script, makes it possible for contracts to get info from any historical TX without impacting scalability
- Chainwork oracle, would allow prediction markets on network difficulty, and creation of a fully decentralized ""steadycoin"" that would track cost of hashes without having to rely on a centralized oracle

Costs? Contained to node developer work, everyone else can just swap out the node and continue about their business.
The upgrades have been carefully designed not to increase CPU costs of validating TXs. Jason has built a massive testing suite for this purpose, which will continue to pay dividends in the future, wherever we will want to assess impact of some future Script upgrade, too."

Since a few people weren't sure how to use BCH on our website we figured we'd make a short demo. So here's a 1 min video, going from first visiting the website to having done two prompts.

Step 1: go to www.nano-gpt.com

Step 2: go to ""wallet"" 

Step 3: click the green Bitcoin Cash logo

Step 4: deposit any amount starting at $0.10

Step 5: create images, ask questions, chat, do whatever! 

As the video shows it genuinely takes under a minute to get started. I deposited $0.14, asked a question about where the slogan of BCH comes from which cost $0.005 using GPT-4o, then generated an image of a guy holding a sign saying ""Bitcoin Cash"" for less than $0.01. Our service can of course do much more, with more and better image generation models and a whole host of the top LLMs. 

Enjoy, hope this helps some people who weren't sure how the website worked!

The tool allows you to fund a batch of vouchers (we're calling them stamps) that can be printed out and given out at events for marketing, given to friends, or left as a tip.

A stamp has a QR code that can be scanned in the wallet and will then sweep the stamp's value into it. I think the sweeping is only currently supported in the [Bitcoin.com](http://Bitcoin.com) wallet, but we've been working with the Selene guys to get it implemented into their wallet.

People consider fiat paper notes to be ""money"" despite these papers losing appreciably in value over time (research 'inflation' if you don't believe).

As long as the loss of value happens slowly enough, people don't pay much attention to it and will still use it as money. This is proven out by everyday reality around us, and it also makes sense.

If you can get 99,96% of the previous day's value of your money in return for things you need to survive, you're going to take it rather than some asset that purports to hold value better but in fact loses you more value (whether through high network fees or exchange costs) when you trade it for more liquid goods and isn't much usable for your survival because it's not accepted as money in most places.

I'm making this post because I'm tired of the trope that BTC supposedly holding value better than other things somehow makes it a good money.

No, it would be good money if it were widely adopted in commerce, as an accepted currency.

Yet, for years prominent BTC'ers were arguing that it cannot fulfill this role, instead of working to make it so. They were in fact working on their own prophecy of Bitcoin not becoming a better form of money than existing ones.

It's high time to turn this around, but it's not going to be BTC that does it."

And here also the prologue of the book to see if this interests you in the first place:

""Prologue: Liang Wei
Kuerle, 2023

“Do you have any last words?” 
Liang Wei lay strapped to the operating table, ignoring the surgeon’s question. His eyes looked past him, scanning the room with a detached curiosity. The walls were a pristine white, the equipment state-of-the-art and gleaming. The room was eerily silent, except for the occasional beep of the machines surrounding him. An array of scalpels was lined up next to him on a tray. To his right he saw a row of identical boxes the size of small travel bags sitting on a long, stainless steel table. On top of each one was a small syringe.

He looked at the two young nurses that darted around the room. He pondered the future they faced in a world increasingly controlled by the very technology he had helped pioneer. With artificial intelligence and surveillance technology advancing at a breakneck pace, he knew their lives would be more closely scrutinized, controlled and manipulated than every generation that has come before. He had tried to guide the development of these new marvels of technology in the right direction. The leather straps holding him down were a somber reminder that he failed.
A third nurse, standing next to the surgeon, was diligently preparing his arm for the impending needle insertion. Her age was difficult to tell behind the mask. As he locked eyes with her, he noticed a small birthmark in the shape of a half-moon above her right temple. A look of anguish was in her eyes. An inexplicable urge welled up within him to offer her consolation, to assure her that all would be well, but before he could open his mouth, she finished the preparation and retreated to a corner of the room where a tall, silent man loomed, his eyes observing the proceedings with a stern gaze. Liang Wei instantly recognized the imposing figure as Zhang Rui, the unwavering officer who had been his warden throughout his last months of imprisonment. 

“Mr. Liang. Any last words?” 
Wei’s eyes shifted back to the surgeon. He was an unassuming man, somewhat portly with a modest build. Faint lines were etched around his eyes, betraying years of experience. His small hands, held upright, were covered with blue surgical gloves. In his right hand he held a scalpel. Though the man was a stranger to him, he was the key to implementing his last directives. Wei couldn’t help but experience a blend of anxiety and expectancy as he studied the man, acutely aware that his plan was entirely dependent on these tiny hands.
Wei’s mind raced back to his own past. He had been born in the mid-1970s, at a time when China was just beginning to emerge from the shadow of the Cultural Revolution. A child of poor parents, he had grown up in a small apartment in Hefei, surrounded by the sights and sounds of a city and country in transition. Despite the many challenges he had faced, Wei had been a precocious child. Growing up, he had always been fascinated by technology and computers, and he spent every spare moment tinkering with electronic equipment. As he grew older, his ambitions grew with him. After graduating at the top of his class in computer sciences and informatics, he entered the workforce at the end of the last millennia; the advent of a new era where he had been witness to the rapid rise of the Chinese economy, full of endless opportunities for those with the right skills and drive. He had been one of those people, dedicating himself entirely to building his own business empire. With a sharp mind and strong determination, he quickly made a name for himself in China’s booming tech industry. After failing with his first startup, he achieved his breakthrough with his second company PayMo which revolutionized the way people could make transactions with their mobile phones. It was an uphill battle, but Liang Wei’s hard work and headstrong character paid off. His company grew rapidly and expanded across the country. At its peak, they offered payment services to over half a billion people.

The combination of his headstrong character and his company’s prominent role in China’s financial system proved to be his downfall in the end. If he had shown a bit more restraint and voiced his criticism of the People’s Bank of China more diplomatically, things might have developed differently. Yet, he did not regret his actions. Changing his inherent character was beyond his control, even if it contributed to his undoing. Now, with his own life coming to an end, he took comfort in knowing that he played a significant part in his people’s unprecedented rise from a poverty-stricken nation that had been subjected to foreign and internal terror for decades to a prosperous and thriving modern society with a controlling seat at the table of world powers. His unshakable spirit had played a small but important role in facilitating this incredible transformation, and he accepted his fate with a sense of quiet pride. He took solace in knowing that, even in death, his legacy would endure, a testament to a life lived fiercely and without compromise. The realization provided him with an unusual sense of calm.
He drew a measured breath to steady his nerves and looked into the surgeon’s eyes. “I am ready; you know what you have to do.”  

The surgeon offered a nearly imperceptible nod, indiscernible to anyone else in the room but him, and signaled the anesthesiologist to begin. Gradually, the fluid coursed through Wei's veins and he departed from this world."""

### 1. **Tesla (TSLA)**
   - **Likelihood**: 70%
   - **Reasoning**: Tesla already has a significant stake in Bitcoin and has shown a willingness to hold and even transact in it. Elon Musk’s interest in cryptocurrencies suggests that Tesla could increase its holdings, especially if Bitcoin's utility as a payment method or store of value becomes more attractive.

### 2. **Square/Block, Inc. (SQ)**
   - **Likelihood**: 85%
   - **Reasoning**: Square has been a leader in integrating Bitcoin into its ecosystem, particularly with its Cash App. Jack Dorsey, the former CEO, is a strong advocate for Bitcoin, and the company's commitment to the cryptocurrency space makes it highly likely they will buy more Bitcoin as part of their growth strategy.

### 3. **PayPal (PYPL)**
   - **Likelihood**: 60%
   - **Reasoning**: PayPal’s involvement in cryptocurrency through its platform suggests an interest in digital currencies. However, as a more traditional financial services company, they may approach further Bitcoin investments cautiously, depending on regulatory developments and customer demand.

### 4. **Galaxy Digital Holdings (GLXY)**
   - **Likelihood**: 90%
   - **Reasoning**: As a company focused on digital assets and blockchain, Galaxy Digital is highly likely to continue increasing its Bitcoin holdings. Their business model revolves around the crypto space, and acquiring more Bitcoin would align with their strategy of being a major player in digital assets.

### 5. **Coinbase (COIN)**
   - **Likelihood**: 75%
   - **Reasoning**: As one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges, Coinbase is deeply embedded in the Bitcoin ecosystem. While their primary business is facilitating transactions, holding more Bitcoin could align with their strategic interests, especially if they see Bitcoin as a long-term asset class.

### Additional Companies for Consideration:

### 6. **Microsoft (MSFT)**
   - **Likelihood**: 25%
   - **Reasoning**: Microsoft has shown interest in blockchain technology but has been more cautious about directly investing in cryptocurrencies. While a small allocation to Bitcoin is possible, it would likely be a minor part of their overall strategy. Their large cash reserves make it feasible, but their conservative financial approach reduces the likelihood.

### 7. **Apple (AAPL)**
   - **Likelihood**: 15%
   - **Reasoning**: Apple is known for being conservative with its cash reserves and investments. While the company could theoretically invest in Bitcoin, it would be a significant shift from its current strategy. The likelihood is low unless there’s a clear strategic benefit tied to their product ecosystem.

### 8. **Amazon (AMZN)**
   - **Likelihood**: 20%
   - **Reasoning**: Amazon has been rumored to explore cryptocurrency-related initiatives, but it hasn’t publicly committed to Bitcoin. While they might consider it as a hedge or part of a broader digital currency strategy, the likelihood of a significant Bitcoin purchase in the near term remains relatively low.

### 9. **Facebook/Meta (META)**
   - **Likelihood**: 40%
   - **Reasoning**: Meta’s pivot towards the metaverse and digital currencies (like their previous Libra/Diem project) suggests an openness to digital assets. However, with regulatory challenges and their focus on building new platforms, they might be cautious about investing heavily in Bitcoin.

### 10. **Amazon (AMZN)**
   - **Likelihood**: 20%
   - **Reasoning**: Amazon has been rumored to explore cryptocurrency-related initiatives, but it hasn’t publicly committed to Bitcoin. While they might consider it as a hedge or part of a broader digital currency strategy, the likelihood of a significant Bitcoin purchase in the near term remains relatively low.

### Summary:
- **High Likelihood** (70% and above): Tesla, Square/Block, Galaxy Digital.
- **Moderate Likelihood** (40%-70%): Coinbase, PayPal.
- **Low Likelihood** (25%-40%): Microsoft, Meta.
- **Very Low Likelihood** (Below 25%): Apple, Amazon.

These estimates are speculative and depend on various factors, including market conditions, regulatory changes, and shifts in corporate strategy. The landscape for corporate Bitcoin adoption could change rapidly, especially as more companies explore the potential of digital assets.

*NanoGPT offers access to the top LLMs and image generation models without subscription and without requiring personal information. Deposit as little as $0.10 in BCH and get started.*

So, a few small updates.

**API keys:**

We had quite some requests for API access for both images and text. It's now possible, in [Settings](https://nano-gpt.com/settings), to generate an API key. This API key can then be used to access our service programmatically.

There's some basic documentation with a Python code example. To convert it to any other programming language we'd recommend feeding it into one of our LLMs and just asking it ""I want this, but then in -insert programming language here-"".

**New models:**

Llama-3.1 405b and Llama-3.1 70b have been added. These are the most performant open-source models, with Llama-3.1 405b by most estimates roughly matching GPT-4o (at \~half the cost per prompt)!

GPT-4o mini has replaced GPT-3.5-Turbo, since GPT-4o-mini is cheaper *and* performs better.

Sonar Online 128k has replaced Sonar Online 32k. This online model (has web access) now has a bigger input window (128k max input words versus 32k) and is built on the better performing Llama-3.1 versus Llama-3.

**Update on BCH deposits:**

We've seen quite some BCH deposits but feel like most in the BCH community aren't aware that our service exists yet and haven't tried it out. At the same time, we know from experience that there are many people that could save a lot of money by moving from an LLM subscription to our pay-per-prompt model, with the added advantage that you can now pay in BCH.

We'd love for more people to try out out service so I'm sending out prefunded accounts to anyone interested. No strings attached, no need to even register, no personal information required. Just reply here or shoot me a DM and I'll send you a link."

Pay a little, get some hotspot time.

Would have been a godsend in some places where getting roaming Internet on a mobile is difficult.

Locals could offset their network costs a bit by selling bandwidth to travelers this way.

To protect your privacy better as a client one might want to connect to the net via Tor over such hotspots, since otherwise the hotspot provider might sniff your traffic. But the basic connectivity should be attractive.

**TL:DR** The Bitcoin Act is trying to create a Bitcoin reserve to manage the federal government's holdings of Bitcoin. They will provide a transparent purchasing plan for Bitcoin which would be held and potentially be used to reduce our nation’s debt.

“To establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and other programs to ensure the transparent management of Bitcoin holdings of the Federal Government, to offset costs utilizing certain resources of the Federal Reserve System, and for other purposes.” Direct Text from the Bill

**Strategic Bitcoin Reserve:** This will create the SBR or the “Strategic Bitcoin Reserve” which includes decentralized secure storage facilities across the U.S. This reserve would be managed by the Secretary of Treasury (which is basically America's money manager) to keep Bitcoin and the private keys safe.

Bill Text “The Secretary shall establish 5 a decentralized network of secure Bitcoin storage facilities 6 distributed across the United States, collectively to be 7 known as the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve for the cold storage age of Government Bitcoin holdings.”

**Bitcoin Purchase Program:** The government will buy 200,000 Bitcoin per year for 5 years, with scheduled buying to avoid market disruptions (which they will publish prior). Totaling 1Million Bitcoins.

**Individual Sates:** States can also store their Bitcoin holdings in the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, keeping ownership of their holdings separate from other accounts. They would also keep any airdrops or forks associated with their Bitcoin.

**Funding:** The Federal Reserve (which is like the central bank of the United States) sometimes has extra money lying around called surplus funds. The Bitcoin Bill suggests taking some money from this surplus fund to buy Bitcoin and build storage facilities. Not all the surplus funds will be used, just most of it.

The Federal Reserve earns money from investing, and some of this money goes to the U.S Treasury. From 2025 to 2029, $6 billion from these earnings will be used to buy Bitcoin.

The Federal Reserve also will revalue its gold holdings and use the difference in value to fund the Bitcoin program. (no idea how this works or the process but will basically use those earnings to also buy Bitcoin.)

**The Goal:** Hold onto this Bitcoin for at least 20 years to help reduce our nation's unchecked spending. (Unless they decide to sell some to pay off debt, then they could do that) By diversifying their assets, they can strengthen the U.S. dollar.

**Bonus**: She is also helping the University of Wyoming establish a Bitcoin College Department.

**The One Thing: Consolidation of Government Bitcoin Holdings.** The bill plans to consolidate Bitcoin holdings, including approximately 210,000 Bitcoin seized from the illegal dark web site Silk Road, into the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. These Bitcoins were seized due to their involvement in illegal activities. People may be split on this; can the government really seize and repurpose your Bitcoin to pay down debt? Idk I’m not a lawyer……"

1269,The Tax Implications of Crytpo Assets vs. Crypto Currencies,19,1ej4xvl,https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/1ej4xvl/the_tax_implications_of_crytpo_assets_vs_crypto/,5,2024-08-03 20:11:35,"Hijacking Bitcoin Core to transform it from an 'Medium of Exchange' into a 'Store of Value' was step 1. Pushing it aggressively in the media and Wall Street to make sure it was the first crypto asset in everyone's lexicon was step 2. And the final result was a Masterclass in social engineering.

To illustrate, consider the different way that the tax code treats currencies and commodities.

As explained by [deepai.org](http://deepai.org), purchases with foreign currencies are not subject to capital gains tax, even if they have appreciated in value since the time of purchase:

>**Question:** If an American citizen buys Canadian dollars and then uses those Canadian dollars to make a purchase in the open market, does he owe capital gains tax if the value of those Canadian dollars has appreciated?

>**DeepAI:** In the scenario where the citizen only uses the Canadian dollars for a purchase without converting them back to USD, he would not owe capital gains tax at that time.

However, assets, or commodities, such as gold coins, are subject to capital gains even if they are being used to make purchases:

>**Question:** If an American citizen uses a gold coin to make a purchase, does he owe capital gains tax if at the time of purchase the gold coin has appreciated in value?

>**DeepAI:** Yes, if an American citizen buys a gold coin and then uses it to make a purchase, they may owe capital gains tax if the coin has appreciated in value at the time of the transaction. **For tax purposes, using a gold coin (or any other asset) as a form of payment is treated as a sale of that asset.**

In this way, Bitcoin's hijacked core has helped the industry transform forever the idea of a crypto *currency* into a crypto *asset* that can be taxed, tracked, and controlled.

Cryto currencies are a threat to the global hegemony of the US dollar and the private banking cartel that controls it. Crypto assets are not.

This is why Bitcoin still has 1MB blocks, is slow and expensive to use, and why CNBC and Wall Street want you to believe it's ""digital gold,"" despite the very first sentence of Satoshi's Whitepaper clearly describing it as electronic cash, to be used without intermediaries:

>**Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System**  
  
>**Abstract.** A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.

And this, in my opinion, is probably why Satoshi has disappeared. Sometime during the hijacking of Core in the mid-2010s, he was either silenced, or worse.

[hijackingbitcoin.com](http://hijackingbitcoin.com)

*Edit: It turns out AI was wrong. Transacting in a foreign currency over the amount of $200 is potentially subject to capital gains tax if the currency conversion would result in a capital gain. It would appear, however, that this is extremely difficult for the IRS to enforce and likely only applies to very large foreign transactions. This would be nearly impossible to enforce with a Nation-sized volume of crypto transactions, so the point stands that The Establishment has an extreme personal interest in redefining and recategorizing crypto currencies as crypto assets in order to maintain the global hegemony of the dollar.*"

On Wednesday we completed the first version of the new app indexer (BCHC) intended to supersede BCHD.

We started integrating it into PayButton yesterday but will still require a bit more time to have that working + tested.

If you'd like to support the effort, we are still running a [small flipstarter](https://flipstarter.paybutton.org/) to cover the costs of having to hire a developer for this.

For those curious, here's a few areas that have been improved over the current pre-release of BCHD (in order of importance):

* **Much more stable** - no longer needing to periodically restart the indexer due to unrecoverable crashes
* **Faster** - for example, loading in addresses with lots of transactions is no problem; we plan on publishing some benchmarks that showcase the difference
* **Minimal maintenance** - simply upgrading the connected BCHN node is all that's required to stay in consensus; ABLA for example is already supported (and is not supported in BCHD)
* **Fallback Support** - it's trivial to connect multiple BCHC instances to a single app to better ensure 100% uptime if maintenance is needed
* **Easier to use** - includes a properly maintained JS library

There's more that we'd like to do but we think this is good for now given that the app usage on BCHD has been completely reset.

If you have other questions about the project, feel free to ask."

It would be somewhat equivalent to ""flex funding"" on a place like IndieGoGo for the lower limit with the upper limit acting as a ""maximum stretch goal"" equivalent. It would be a lot easier to set this kind of ""goal range"" rather than trying to guess exactly where the magic number should be somewhere in the middle of it.

Any thoughts?"

1304,Can indicators predict the future of crypto or BTC with high accuracy?,14,1egm2ww,https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/1egm2ww/can_indicators_predict_the_future_of_crypto_or/,6,2024-07-31 18:06:40,"I'll get ahead of the commentators but absolutely NO, indicators cannot predict the future with great accuracy. Sense of then its help traders observe trends to gauge their direction and strength. Think of it like Newton’s physics: a price movement has momentum, and the bigger it is, the harder it is to stop (inertia). This concept is reflected in the saying: “The trend is your friend.”

To illustrate this, imagine there are 21 days left until Christmas, and a popular toy is flying off the shelves. If you’re a store owner considering stocking up on these toys, you might observe the sales trends of neighboring stores. If sales rise from 20,000 to 30,000 units a day, you might decide to stock up. However, if sales suddenly drop, you'd be cautious. Even with a good prediction, replicating the exact sales figures isn’t feasible.

Indicators work similarly by using formulas and charts to help traders visualize potential future movements of prices and market behavior. Here’s a look at some commonly used indicators:

# 1. Ishimoku Clouds

The **Ishimoku Clouds** indicator consists of five lines representing averages over different periods. When two lines cross, the area between them forms a ""cloud."" If the price is above the cloud, it indicates an uptrend; below the cloud suggests a downtrend. The direction and movement of the cloud help assess the strength of the trend.

# 2. Relative Strength Index (RSI)

The **RSI** is a simple yet powerful tool that shows whether an asset is overbought or oversold. It uses historical data to gauge demand. The RSI has two key levels: 30% (oversold) and 70% (overbought). Values above 70% might indicate a potential price drop, while values below 30% suggest a possible price rise.

# 3. Moving Averages

**MA** smooth out price data over a specific period to help identify trends. They are useful for spotting support and resistance levels. Short-term MAs react quickly to price changes, while long-term MAs provide a broader view. Support levels indicate where prices might stop falling, while resistance levels show where prices might struggle to rise.

# 4. Fibonacci Levels

**Fibonacci Levels** are another tool for predicting price dynamics. They are based on the Fibonacci sequence and provide standard levels (0, 23.6%, 38.1%, 50.0%, 61.8%, 76.4%, 100%) to track price movements. Although not complex, these levels can be useful for understanding potential price retracements and extensions.

# 5. Sales Volume

**Sales Volume** measures the number of assets traded over a period. It’s a crucial indicator as it helps validate price movements. High volume indicates strong market participation and momentum, while low volume suggests weaker momentum. For instance, if the price of Bitcoin spikes but the volume is low, it might signal that the price movement could reverse.

EDIT: If you think I'm wrong, feel free to criticize me!!! Because I don't think so, but you can still make me understand.

EDIT 2 : And what i mean in automated Ta is something that really use algotrading for analyze of indIcators, not some sh\*tty trading bots.In more detail, we can generally analyze briefly MACD on this dashboard, at the moment the trend in BTC is clearly bullish, respectively, in a bull market you should sell what you have already bought before in a bearish trend. 

This dashboard uses algorithms to calculate indicators and their score on their own buy/sell scale, where high scale mean buy. I hope you find it useful if you are learning or want to simplify your technical analysis as much as it helped me

2 questions.

1) if you’ve been spending from a wallet would you need to set up a new private key, or can you just send all to a fresh address within that private key and then be fine?  Basically if you’ve ever moved funds from a private key is that going to be compromised in the future and therefore need to set up an entirely new wallet?  Or is a new address within the private key fine?

2) what is BTC and BCH developing for quantum resistance."

1316,Let's talk about block time for 1000th time,29,1efoq4d,https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/1efoq4d/lets_talk_about_block_time_for_1000th_time/,125,2024-07-30 14:39:14,"There was a recent discussion (Telegram /bchchannel/394356) about block times and I'd like to revive this topic. I was initially opposed to the idea of changing the blocktime just because I thought it would be too costly and complicated to implement, but what if it wouldn't? What if the costs would be worth it? I was skeptical about the benefits, too, but I changed my mind on that, too. I will lay it out below.

Obviously we'd proportionately adjust emission, DAA, and ABLA. My main concern was locktime and related Script opcodes, but those are solvable, too.

The main drawback of reducing blocktime would be a one-time setback to scalability, e.g. to keep orphan rates the same we can't just both reduce time & blocksize limit to 1/5, we'd have to reduce blocksize limit more, maybe to 1/8 or something. Eventually, with tech growth, we'd recover from there and continue growing our capacity beyond that. This is why I believe an alternative to simple blocktime reducrtion, [Tailstorm](https://old.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/1eec98b/tailstorm_what_if_we_could_have_faster_block/), is the most promising direction of research, because we could have faster blocks without this hit on scalability/orphan rates and we could go down to 10s (as opposed to 2min with just plain blocktime reduction).

I'll just copy [my BCR post](https://bitcoincashresearch.org/t/lets-talk-about-block-time/471/67) here:

# The 0-conf Adoption Problem

I love 0-conf, it works fantastic as long as you stay in the 0-conf zone. But as soon as you want to do something outside the zone, you'll be hit with the wait. If you could do everything inside the 0-conf zone, that would be great, but unfortunately for us - you can't.

How I see it, we can get widespread adoption of 0-conf in 2 ways:
1. Convince existing big players to adopt 0-conf. They're all multi-coin (likes of BitPay, Coinbase, Exodus, etc.) and, like it or not, BCH right now is too small for any of those to be convinced by our arguments pro 0-conf. Maybe if we give it 18-more-months™ they will start accepting 0-conf? /s
2. Grow 0-conf applications & services. This is viable and we have been in fact been growing it. However, growth on this path is constrained by human resources working on such apps. There's only so many builders, and they still have to compete for users with other cryptos, services from 1., and with fiat incumbents.

We want to grow the total number of people using BCH, right?

Do our potential new users have to first to go through 1. in order to even try 2.? How many potential users do we fail to convert if they enter through 1.? If user's first experience of BCH is through 1. then the UX suffers and maybe the users will just give up and go elsewhere, without bothering to try any of our apps from 2.

Is that the reason that, since '17, LTC's on-chain metrics grew more than BCH's?

In any case, changing the block time doesn't hamper 0-conf efforts, and if it would positively impact the user funnel from 1. to 2. then it would result in increase of 0-conf adoption, too!

# What about Avalanche, TailStorm, ZCEs, etc.?

Whatever finality improvements can be done on top of 10-minute block time base, the same can be done on top of 2-minue block time base.
Even if we shipped some improvement like that - we would still have to convince payment processors etc. to recognize it and reduce their confirmation requirements.
This is a problem similar to our 0-conf efforts. Would some new tech be more likely to gain recognition from same players who couldn't be convinced to support 0-conf?

How I see it, changing the block time is the only way to **improve UX all across and all at once**, without having to convince services 1 by 1 and having to depend on their good will.

# Main Benefits of Reducing Block Time to 2 minutes

## 1. Instant improvement in 1-conf experience

Think payment processors like BitPay, ATM operators, multi-coin wallets, etc. Some multi-coin wallets won't even show incoming TX until it has 1 conf! Imagine users waiting 20 minutes and thinking ""Did something go wrong with my transfer?"".

BCH reducing the block time would result in **automatic and immediate improvement of UX** for users whose first exposure to BCH is through these services.

With a random process like PoW mining is, there's a **14% chance you'll have to wait more than 2 times the target** ([Poisson distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_distribution)) in order to get that 1-conf.

This means that with target block time of 2 minutes, a 14% outlier block would take 4 minutes which is still psychologically tolerable but with 10-minute target it would take 20 minutes which is intolerable. Ask yourself, after how many minutes of waiting do you start to get annoyed?

Specific studies for crypto UX haven't been done but maybe [this one](https://www.icmi.com/resources/2017/what-do-customers-really-think-about-long-wait-times) can give us an idea of where the tolerable / intolerable threshold is:

>A 2014 American Express survey found that the maximum amount of time customers are willing to wait is 13 minutes.

So 20 minutes are intolerable, and there's a 14% chance of experiencing that every time you use BCH outside the 0-conf zone!

With target of 144 blocks per day, there will be about 20 blocks longer than 20 minutes every day.
If you're using BCH once every day, after 1 week of use there's a 65% chance you'll have had at least one such slow experience.

If you're a newbie, you may decide to go and complain on some social media. Then you'll be met with old-timers with their usual arguments ""Just use 0-conf!"", ""It's fixable if only X would do Y!"". How will that look like from perspective of new users? Also, if we somehow grow the number of users, and % will complain, then the number of complainers will grow as well! Who will meet and greet all of them?

Or, you'll get on general crypto forum and people will just tell you ""Bruh, BCH is slow, just go use something else.""

**With 2-minute blocks, however, there'd be only a 0.2% chance of having to wait more than 12 minutes for 1-conf!** In other words, 99.8% blocks would fall into the tolerable zone, unlikely to trigger an user enough to go and complain.

## 2. Instant improvement in multi-conf experience

Assume that exchanges will have target wait time of 1 hour, i.e. require 6 x 10-min confirmations or 30 x 2-min confirmations. On average, nothing changes, right? Devil is in the details.

Users don't care about aggregate averages, they care about their individual experience, and they will have expectations about their individual experience:

1. The time until something happens (progress gets updated for +1) will be 1 hour / N.
2. The number of confirmations will smoothly increase from 0 / N to N / N
3. I will have to wait 1 hour in total

How does the individual UX differ depending on target block time?

1. See 1-conf above, with 10-min target the perception of something being stuck will occur more often than not.
2. Infrequent updating of progress state negatively impacts perception of smoothly increasing progress indicator.
3. Variance means that with 10-min blocks the 1 hour will be more often exceed by a lot than with 2-min blocks. Here are the numbers for this:

expected to wait | actually having to wait more than | probability with 10-minute blocks | probability with 2-minute blocks
-- | -- | -- | --
60 | 70 | 28.5% | 15%
60 | 80 | 15.1% | 2%
60 | 90 | 6.2% | 0.09%
60 | 100 | 1.7% | 0.0007%

Note that even when waiting 80 minutes, the experience will differ depending on target time: with 10 min the total wait may exceed 80 min just due to 1 extremely slow block, or 2 blocks getting ""stuck"" for 20 minutes each. With 2 min target, it will still regularly update, the slowdown will be experienced as a bunch of 3-5min blocks, with the ""progress bar"" still updating.

This ""progress bar"" effect has noticeable impact on making even a longer wait more tolerable:

[IMAGE - Tolerable Waiting Time](https://bitcoincashresearch.org/uploads/default/optimized/2X/8/850f1aea70069b2fb40e299e32e207c1c4e78f83_2_690x378.jpeg)

([source](https://uxdesign.cc/loading-progress-indicators-ui-components-series-f4b1fc35339a?gi=3d1e531da9bb))

This study was for page loading times where expected waiting time is much lower so this is in seconds and can't directly apply to our case, but we can at least observe how the progress bar effect increases tolerable waiting time.

# 3. DeFi

While our current DeFi apps are all working smoothly with 0-conf, there's always a risk of 0-conf chains getting invalidated by some alternative TX or chain, either accidentally (concurrent use by many users) or intentionally (MEV).

# But Would We Lose on Scalability / Decentralization?

During the discussion on Telegram, someone linked to a [great past discussion](https://old.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/chjwao/statement_on_the_discussion_of_shortening_block/) on Reddit, where @jtoomim said:

> The main concern I have about shortening the block time is that **shorter block times reduce the capacity of the network** , as they make the block propagation bottleneck worse. If you make blocks come 10x as fast, then you get a 10x higher orphan rate. To compensate and keep the network safe, we would need to reduce the block size limit, but decreasing block size by 10x would not be enough. To compensate for a 10x increase in block speed, we would need to reduce block size by about 20x. The reason for this is that block propagation time roughly follows the following equation:
> ```
> block_prop_time = first_byte_latency + block_size/effective_bandwidth
> ```
> If the block time becomes 10x lower, then block_prop_time needs to fall 10x as well to have the same orphan rate and safety level. But because of that constant `first_byte_latency` term, you need to reduce block_size by more than 10x to achieve that. If your first_byte_latency is about 1 second (i.e. if it takes 1 second for an empty block to be returned via stratum from mining hardware, assembled into a block by the pool, propagated to all other pools, packaged into a stratum job, and distributed back to the miners), and if the maximum tolerable orphan rate is 3%, then a 60 second block time will result in a 53% loss of safe capacity versus 600 seconds, and a 150 second block time will result in an 18% loss of capacity.

([source](https://old.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/chjwao/statement_on_the_discussion_of_shortening_block/euudj5r/))

So yes, we'd lose something in technological capacity, but our blocksize limit floor is currently at 32 MB, while technological limit is at about 200 MB, so we still have headroom to do this.

If we changed block time to 2 minutes and blocksize limit floor to 6.4 MB in proportion - we'd keep our current capacity the same, but our technological limit would go down maybe to 150 MB.
However, technology will continue to improve at same rates, so from there it would still continue to improve as network technology improves, likely before our adoption and adaptive blocksize limit algorithm would get anywhere close to it.

## What About Costs of Implementing This?

In the same comment, J. Toomim gave a good summary:

>If we change the block time once, that change is probably going to be permanent. Changing the block time requires quite a bit of other code to be modified, such as block rewards, halving schedules, and the difficulty adjustment algorithm. It also requires modifying all SPV wallet code, which most other hard forks do not. Block time changes are much harder than block size changes. And each time we change the block time, we have to leave the code in for both block times, because nodes have to validate historical blocks as well as new blocks. Because of this, I think it is best to not rush this, and to make sure that if we change the block time, we pick a block time that will work for BCH forever.

These costs would be one-off and mostly contained to node software, and *some* external software.

Ongoing costs would somewhat increase because block headers would grow by 57.6 kB/day as opposed to 11.52kB/day now.

Benefits would pay off dividends in perpetuity: 1-conf would forever be within tolerable waiting time.

## But Could We Still Call Ourselves Bitcoin?

Who's to stop us? Did Bitcoin ever make this promise: ""Bitcoin must be slow forever""? No, it didn't.

## But What Would BTC Maxis Say?

Complaining about BCH making an objective UX improvement that works good would just make them look like clowns, imagine this conversation:

A: ""Oh but you changed something and it works good!""

B: ""Yes."""

From the abstract:

>Tailstorm merges multiple recent protocol improvements addressing security, confirmation latency, and throughput with a novel incentive mechanism improving fairness. We implement a parallel proof-of-work consensus mechanism with *k* PoWs per block to obtain state-of-the-art consistency guarantees [29]. Inspired by Bobtail [9] and Storm [4], we structure the individual PoWs in a tree which, by including a list of transactions with each PoW, reduces confirmation latency and improves throughput. Our proposed incentive mechanism discounts rewards based on the depth of this tree. Thereby, it effectively punishes information withholding, the core attack strategy used to reap an unfair share of rewards.

If we want to achieve faster TX confirmations on Bitcoin Cash then we could consider this as the most promising direction of research.

* He stated that the U.S Department of Justice has custody of 200,000 BTC 

2) RFJ Jr. gave a talk as well, who could hold a position in Trump's party.

* He says he’ll make the U.S Govt. Buy $615m in BTC
* Wants it to match the U.S. gold reserves ($543B)
* He has previously said he wants to get rid of BTC Capital Gain Taxes

3) Senator Synthia Lummis or the “Bitcoin Senator” introduces a bill (that has a long way before becoming real) for the U.S to build a Bitcoin Reserve Bill with secure storage vaults, and visible purchase programs and over the next 5 years to own 5% of the worlds BTC supply. She wants to hold the Bitcoin for 20 years to help reduce the US debt.

4) Former and current Republican nominee Donald. J. Trump gave a speech at the conference. He made some bold statements that would be wonderful for digital assets if they became true.

* He wants the U.S Govt to keep 100% of the BTC it owns (not sure how people will feel since the BTC they own was seized)
* Create a National BTC stockpile
* Fire Gary Gensler (SEC chair who’s hurting digital assets in the USA)
* “Mined, Minted and Made in the USA”
* 1st president to accept Bitcoin as a donation.
* Will kill any CBDC plans (CBDC is a government currency that people think is overreaching)

5) Cantor-Fitzgerald's CEO (a longtime New York investment firm that was devastated by 9/11) gave a speech as well.

* He says Cantor-Fitzgerald owns “a shit ton of Bitcoin”
* He stated that Cantor and all of its partners are a fan of Bitcoin
* He argues that BTC should be treated the same as gold

Digital assets are increasingly becoming a political issue, for good or bad. In what seems like a response to the Republican party speaking favorably of Digital assets, Democrats wrote to the DNC party (Democratic National Party, the people behind who’s supporting Kamala Harris who’s running against Trump) asking them to stop being so anti-crypto."

Our novel consensus, Proof of Performance (PoP), leverages a new design paradigm we call True Decentralization. This First Principles approach delivers the safety of uncompromising global decentralization.

Scaling and Decentralization are unified in a way that hasn’t been done before. Network participants are incentivized to deploy useful hardware; CPUs, bandwidth, memory, and more; to handle trillions of transactions daily.

The Litheum team's goal is to solve real problems and change the narrative of the blockchain space, with a bigger focus on technology, user friendliness, long-term value, education, and accessibility.

We believe that privacy and freedom delivered by Truly Decentralized technology can make the world a better place, that True Decentralization is simple and understandable, and that PoP guarantees everyone access to decentralized technology. Litheum is Different, welcome to the Bigchain!

The Litheum Story

In 2011, Clayton first encountered the Bitcoin Whitepaper and was immediately captivated. He spent the next 72 hours researching this groundbreaking technology and enthusiastically sharing his findings with friends and family.

By 2014, Clayton had joined Google, relocating from New York to Mountain View to be at the heart of the company. He foresaw the dual emergence of AI and Blockchain as pivotal trends.

As part of Google’s Ad Traffic Quality team, Clay learned what it takes to build internet-scale applications. More importantly, though, he was struck by the fact that Google was putting thousands of engineers into the AI space, but had literally zero interest in Blockchain.

After leaving Google, Clayton immersed himself in the Blockchain space, developing Blockchain Bridge, a turn-key solution for enterprise integration with Ethereum. However, he was frustrated by the gas problem and began to realize that building Truly Decentralized applications was impossible on the current infrastructure.

In 2017, he was further disillusioned in the technology as Bitcoin gave up on the original vision, pivoting from a global cash-like payments system to “digital gold”. Predicting the limitations of the Lightning Network in addressing scalability, he grew skeptical of both Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash, whose communities both seemed unable to contend with the fundamental problem.

After Joining Saito, a project promising a solution to scalability, Clayton delved deeper into the economic problems hindering blockchain scalability and their technical solutions. However, by 2021, he became convinced that Saito would not fulfill its objectives. This realization spurred him to design Proof of Performance. After successfully implementing the technology for Saito’s Token and IDO, he departed in November to focus on Litheum.

Since then, the Litheum team has expanded, comprising top-tier engineers hand-picked by Clayton through a rigorous Silicon Valley-style interview process, and a marketing team uniquely attuned to decentralized technology and its impact on user experience and security.

With the only Blockchain built from the First Principles of True Decentralization, we believe that Litheum is poised to reshape this space, finally delivering the truly impactful Decentralized Applications that we have all been dreaming of since the beginning

It also allows image generation through DALL-E, Stable Diffusion 3, Realistic Vision, and many other image models.

[BCH announcement video](https://reddit.com/link/1edayet/video/lkgkpnofn0fd1/player)

There's no need for any subscription - you can add funds at any time through Bitcoin Cash (from $0.10) or Nano and pay per prompt/image. It costs \~$0.02 per prompt and \~$0.02-$0.10 per image. Using NanoGPT is fully anonymous and private: chats and prompts are stored only locally on your device. Everything you generate is 100% yours: generate an image and use it as your logo! It's how we got our logo, in fact.

We use 0-conf and have a low minimum so that anyone can easily try out our service, and think our payment flow works really smoothly and quickly (thanks partly to promptcash which we recommend to anyone considering BCH payments).

Crypto is awesome when it has actual utility, and we hope to fill a gap of people asking ""but what can I do with it"". Anyone who bought, was gifted, or earned even a tiny amount of BCH can get real use out of it on NanoGPT!

We've had quite a lot of feedback from the BCH community the past week while we beta-ed this new payment route, but more feedback and suggestions are always welcome!"

Recently ETH which was premined got approved for ETF's, therefore its just a matter of time that BCH, DOGE and LTC get ETF's as well, since obviously the SEC has completely changed their crypto stance and are not fighting applications anymore, even for some premined cryptos such as ETH.

The first scene shows highlighted text stating ""Without going through a financial institution."" This can't be referring to BTC, as it requires lightning nodes to function in a peer-to-peer manner, which we all know will likely be owned by financial institutions due to the opening and closing channel fees.

Cathy Wood also makes a good point that the current system (Visa, MasterCard, etc.) takes nine steps for a transaction to happen, whereas with Bitcoin it only takes two. Again, it appears that they're describing BCH because, while BTC can work peer-to-peer, it can't do so for regular transactions, making it more closely related to BCH.

The documentary doesn't mention anything about BTC's really high fees and slow transaction times, but when related to the true Bitcoin, BCH, it all makes sense. Have a watch and see what you think."

The message from the anonymous mod was not very specific other than saying I ""broke the rules"". So I looked back at my recent post history, and I had a few posts recently in a post in that sub about Twitter planning on implementing the ability to mark that your tweet not allow any links in the replies.

Most of the redditors commenting flipped out saying it was Elon's evil right-wing plan to keep people from posting links that refute right-wing misinformation during the election.  2 of my comments were deleted by the mods, so I assume those were the offending comments. I can still see them in my history though.  The first was a joke:

> I guess the left can make their own twitter if they want.

I thought it was ironic, because that's how the left acted and what they said when the right complained about Twitter banning right leaning people and posts, and blocking links to articles that turned out to be true that they called misinformation.  I guess that could be against their ""trolling"" rule. I don't know.

Ironically I'm also banned on twitter which happened well after Elon took over. I'm a libertarian so I have the privilege of being hated by the left and right. Twitter also never told me what rule I broke or pointed out where even though I appealed multiple times. I suspect it was that I broke Elon's rule about promoting other social networks, when I made some posts about memo.cash.

The other post that they deleted on the r/Technology subreddit was about memo.cash in fact:

> I'm in favor of blockchain based social media (like memo.cash) that are uncensorable, but the left doesn't want that either, they just want to censor things they don't like.

> In fact, such a system could be used to allow uncensorable responses/comments on any site by just adding to the protocol and a browser extension.

I can't for the life of me figure out what rule this comment breaks. They did not delete this comment in the same post:

>Some people have used it to drop out of Presidential Elections.

Nor my comment explaining that the first comment about the left making their own twitter was a joke, so they aren't just deleting all my comments. It's those 2 in particular that they didn't like. I find that they hated the one about uncensorable comments and deemed it to be worthy of censoring quite interesting.

I've been meaning to work on some ideas to enhance memo.cash, just been so busy, but this might light a fire under me to finally do something."

This referral stems from ongoing legal battles where Wright has attempted to assert rights over Bitcoin’s intellectual property. During these proceedings, evidence suggested Wright might have lied under oath and forged documents to support his claims.

The judge also issued injunctions to prevent Wright from re-litigating his claim or threatening lawsuits based on his asserted identity as Nakamoto. Moreover, Wright is required to update his website to admit he is not Satoshi Nakamoto, a directive that underscores the court's doubts about his claims.

Thank you for the donors and to those who liked and commented on previous posts about it. This was my first campaign and I'm super proud to have gotten to this point. Now the work really begins :) 

This has been a great community thus far and I'm excited to share and grow the movement. 

The campaign was to fund development of BCH node software onto the StartOS community registry. Start9 is BTC supportive but has its main focus on sovereign computing. 

Learn more about Start9 here https://start9.com/

They offer servers on which you can install software to become digitally sovereign. Use them to store media, passwords and eventually run your BCH node (When our project is complete)

I've already had my own concerns about the future of reddit for a few years now, but with the API changes and various other issues the concerns have become a lot more serious and urgent, and I'm wondering if we should move the community off reddit (in this case this subreddit would serve as a pointer - but unfortunately there's still no obvious replacement). Lemmy/kbin are closest options right now, but we still need a trustworthy host, and then there's the obvious problem of discoverability/usability and getting newcomers to bother joining. 

##Does anybody have suggestions for where the community could move?

We now think it's impossible to stay in Reddit unless the current reddit admins are forced to change their minds (very unlikely). We're now actively considering our options. Reddit may own the URL, but they do not own the community."
1456,"When using Groth16, is it really needed to change both G₂ points of the public & private inputs in the trusted setup for avoiding public input forgery ?",6,1fz6mfm,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/1fz6mfm/when_using_groth16_is_it_really_needed_to_change/,0,2024-10-08 23:47:02,"First remember ᴇɪᴘ‒197 only allow to check if a set of pairings is equal to 1 in Fp^(12) and not to compare equalities like in Zcash which is why the equations below are different and would worth downvotes on a cryptographic sub as a result…

# For those who don’t know about Groth16 :

By convention, public portions of the witness are the first ℓ elements of the vector **a**. To make those elements public, the prover simply reveals them :

\[*a₁*,*a₂*,…,*a*ℓ\]

For the verifier to test that those values were in fact used, verifier must carry out some of the computation that the prover was originally doing.

Specifically, the prover computes :

[Sorry, but no MathJax on reddit](https://preview.redd.it/pqdtempzezsd1.png?width=536&format=png&auto=webp&s=a2d7fe92e26b9b8bab9961ae693dc8176c663d6f)

Note that only the computation of **\[C\]₁** changed -- the prover only uses the **a**i and Ψ*i* terms ℓ+1 to **m**.

The verifier computes the first ℓ terms of the sum :

[Sorry but no MathJax on reddit](https://preview.redd.it/f0gz8tjrfzsd1.png?width=279&format=png&auto=webp&s=55b2f75d4cb2f4473865f085c1e9146db3d390f1)

And the ᴇɪᴘ‒197 equation in the case of Ethereum on Fp^(12) is : 1?=\[*A*\]₁∙\[*B*\]₂×\[*α*\]₁∙\[*β*\]₂×\[*X*\]₁∙*G₂*×\[*C*\]₁∙*G*₂

# Part 2 : Separating the public inputs from the private inputs with γ and δ

# The first attack described in the tutorial I read and how it’s said to be prevented :

The assumption in the equation above is that the prover is only using Ψ(ℓ+1) to Ψ*m* to compute **\[C\]₁**, but nothing stops a dishonest prover from using Ψ**₁** to Ψℓ to compute **\[C\]₁**, leading to a forged proof.

For example, here is our current ᴇɪᴘ‒197 verification equation :

[Sorry but no MathJax on reddit](https://preview.redd.it/676myt4ckzsd1.png?width=639&format=png&auto=webp&s=56d7cc9cab9a3ff25bb694d27ac4478677a0fbd8)

If we expand the C term under the hood, we get the following :

[Sorry but no MathJax on reddit](https://preview.redd.it/hizdviiblzsd1.png?width=906&format=png&auto=webp&s=8cf492ad7210dcbebdc1676fbdb1c2f57422d191)

Suppose for example and without loss of generality that a=\[1,2,3,4,5\] and ℓ=3. In that case, the public part of the witness is \[1,2,3\] and the private part is \[4,5\].

The final equation after evaluating the witness vector would be as follows :

[Sorry but no MathJax on reddit](https://preview.redd.it/53rakghanzsd1.png?width=963&format=png&auto=webp&s=f1bbc018b64cc369762ef66360066cecb50a5314)

However since the discrete logarithm between the public and private point in ***G₂*** is 1, nothing stops the prover from creating an valid portion of the public witness as \[1,2,0\] and moving the zeroed out public portion to the private part of the computation as follows :

[Sorry but no MathJax on reddit](https://preview.redd.it/2723fvcbqzsd1.png?width=837&format=png&auto=webp&s=cc5a504fc6951399e84d8929ded37a2d9cc9f483)

The equation above is valid, but the witness does not necessarily satisfy the original constraints.

Therefore, we need to prevent the prover from using Ψ**₁** to Ψℓ as part of the computation of **\[C\]₁**.

# Introducing γ and δ :

To avoid the problem above, the trusted setup introduces new scalars γ and δ to force Ψℓ+1 to Ψ*m* to be separate from Ψ**₁** to Ψℓ. To do this, the trusted setup divides (multiplies by the modular inverse) the private terms (that constitute **\[C\]₁**) by γ and the public terms (that constitute **\[X\]₁**, the sum the verifier computes) by δ.

Since the ***h***(***τ***)***t***(***τ***) term is embedded in **\[C\]₁**, those terms also need to be divided by γ.

[Again, no MathJax on reddit](https://preview.redd.it/ua70vela30td1.png?width=613&format=png&auto=webp&s=f45e24b58202d9ae03c5ccf6ca405c6183374dfc)

The prover steps are the same as before and the verifier steps now include pairing by **\[*****γ*****\]₂** and **\[δ\]₂** to cancel out the denominators :

[The ᴇɪᴘ‑197 with Groth16 as it’s expected to be](https://preview.redd.it/jciw7eg470td1.png?width=934&format=png&auto=webp&s=bba29c817295b1a07401a435481ba6fc83f9f766)

# The thing I’m not understanding :

*So it seems to me the description above is the attack is possible because the 2* ***G₂*** *points resulting from the witness input split for public inputs are equals and thus the discrete logarithm is know since it’s equal,* ***In the other case why is it required to modify both the private and public terms ? How could proofs be still faked without knowing the discrete logarithms between*** **δ** ***and G₂ ?***  
**Why not just divide the private terms that constitute \[C\]₁** ***by*** **δ** ***and leave the public terms as is*** *? This would mean :*

It's easy and yields consistently good results. 

I remember NIST saying something about how uniform selection was better, but I do not remember exactly what their logic was. Does Gaussian sampling create exploitable patterns in the output variables, or produce keys that are easier to brute force or something related to constant time implementations?

I imagine this will be the reason why organizations hesitate to switch to post-quantum safe cryptosystems.

After I created the basic one-to-one communication with session keys I upgraded to only the sender key method, every message/data use forward secrecy and AES-256/GCM.

I created a little local chat demo using JSON as storage. It's possible use a ""realtime"" chat opening two accounts  in two cmd.

I uploaded windows+linux binaries with a little readme inside, nothing fancy, only cmd UI

In my opinion it's hard track and associate ""who write what to whom"" without access to the ends. At the moment, because it's only local, I didn't sign DB communication, but the underline code is already in place to check the authenticity of the sender.

In short this protocol should be anonymous and secure in pre-quantum in my opinion.

So in my app the user's password will be used for both account authentication and file encryption key. Below is the schematics of my process

user authentication:  
password + salt -> bcrypt -> stored password hash & salt value in db

when user login, will use bcrypt on the plaintext password and the stored salt value to make sure the hash match with the one in database.

file encryption:  
generate pbkdf2 derived password from main password + salt value (the same one in db) -> this derived key then be used for aes file encryption / decryption key

For the sake of simplicity, I am using the same salt value in the database for both authentication and pdkdf2 aes key generation, I think it's safe, just wanted a second opinion. Thanks"

I've done two summer camps, both heavily focused on cryptology, and I learned about the basics like RSA and other encryption algorithms. I also learned about Shor's algorithm, and cryptology in the post-quantum world. I was under the impression that if an efficient, large-scale quantum computer was built tomorrow, we wouldn't have an algorithm that couldn't just be cracked by Shor's algorithm, but I did more research and I'm pretty sure that's not true anymore. I wanted to get your guys' opinions, on whether or not we have encryption techniques that could be implemented once a quantum computer is manufactured.

If it resonates at 1.0MHz, not 1.1MHz, not 1.2MHz, 1.3MHz, 1.4MHz, that encodes the bits 10011.

An attacker can trivially read the card and impersonate the owner.

I was wondering if instead of a simple resonance, you could have a chip that uses the reader's radio transmitter to induce a logical circuit to perform a digital signature using a key fused into the card, and trigger transistors to switch on the appropriate inductor capacitor circuits to represent that signature.

If the challenge is a MACed nonce and the key is hard to extract, you have a far more secure passive identification system.

Does this exist? Has it been tried?"

I was analyzing Ascon in order to cipher very small plaintext (< rate).  
My main goal is to implement it without the need of authentication and probably with a constant nonce or at least a nonce which can be reused a lot of time.

The problem with Ascon is with short message the absorbing step of the sponge contruction (called plaintext in the NIST submission) is skipped and the ciphering is resumed by a xor between the data and bits coming from the initialisation step. Those bits in our case could be always the same if the nonce is constant.

My question are :

* Is it still possible to use the Ascon to cipher my data even if my nonce is constant ?
* What are the risks of it, if I do it ?
* Do you have better option of lightweigth cipher with no nonce?

Thank you for your help."

For probable security, SPHINCS+ seems great with short sk/pk but long signatures. It is also quite slow, making it very resistant if need be. Good choice for optimal security.

Falcon is my favorite by far as it only comes in two versions, Falcon512 and Falcon1024 comparable to RSA security. I think it is the easy choice to make. It is also quite fast.

Dilithium seems quite interesting too but I don’t know much about it. How does it differ from Falcon.

1504,Why does Monero use a slightly tweaked version of the Schnorr Signature as compared to that described in Cryptography texts/literature?,27,1f3xj3e,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/1f3xj3e/why_does_monero_use_a_slightly_tweaked_version_of/,5,2024-08-29 14:15:14,"Most Cryptography Text & Literature describe Schnorr Signature thus

- Private key 'x' & Public key P = xG where G is the generator
- M is the message to be signed
- Signer samples a random 'r' & computes R = rG
- Signer computes e = Hash(M || R) & s = ex + r
- Signer sends (s, e) as signature.

Verifier computes e' = Hash(M || sG - eP) & checks if e == e'

----  

Multiple Monero texts (say for e.g. ""Zero to Monero"") describe the Schnorr Signature a little different. 

- s is computed by the signer as s = ex - r (instead of s = ex + r)
- So obviously verifier verifies by computing e' =  Hash(M || sG +  eP)

-----------------


(Note, I do know that Monero doesn't use the Schnorr Signature directly but uses it through Ring Signatures - however, even there this +/- difference is there).

I don't think this makes much of a difference, however I am curious as to why Monero does this change.

--------- 


I also found a Crypto.SE comment (not question) which asks something similiar

https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/48616/prove-the-security-of-schnorrs-signature-scheme

Person who asked the question uses the Monero way & claims his reference as Wikipedia. However, currently the Wikipedia Schnorr Page uses the original way - so obviously it has changed since then. 

The moderator of Crypto.SE fgrieu asks in the comments 

> That description is not quite Schnorr's signature scheme as published (see reference and description in this question). Main difference is that in Schnorr's article the hash H
 has narrow output (about half the bitsize of q). **Also the minus sign is applied to x
 during computation of the public key, so that s=k+xemodq (that trivially does not matter to security).** And the notations differ. I wish I knew the origin of the variant in this question, Wikipedia, and the HAC 11.5.3. 

I think the origin of this variant is from Monero. But why?"

Our engineers have developed and patented encryption technique where the the programm using PRNG (Pseudo Random Number generator) generate a unique and unpredictable encryption equitation for each encryption process.

I am not specialist in the cryptography, but our engineers ensures that this technique may be quantum resistant and flexible (can be tuned as symmetric or asymmetric encryption and can be used in different areas, like file encryption or securing communication channel).

I look for people who can express their opinion on this technique. Can you advice where I can find those people?

In a steps the process looks like follows:

1. Read byte array from the file

\[1,22,34,12,45,243,255,11,2,34\]

2. Determine a random variable n , based on entered values min and max

n = rd.randint(min, max)

n = rd.randint(8, 100)

n = 8

3. Split byte array into n parts (randomly, not same size)

\[\[1\], \[22\], \[34\], \[12\], \[45\], \[243\], \[255,11\], \[2,34\]\]

4. Convert 2D array to equation of 1D arrays:

\[1\]+\[22\]+\[34\]+\[12\]+\[45\]+\[243\]+\[255,11\]+\[2,34\]

5. Apply a random encryption or encoding function with math operation for each part

f(x) = aes(\[1\], x1) +rsa(\[22\],x2)+otp(\[34\],x3)+aes(\[12\],x4)+replace(\[45\], x5)+aes(\[243\],x6)+ceaser(\[255,11\], x7)+elipse(\[2,34\],x8)

x1,x2,x3,... - variable with keys for each function.

6. Determine a random variable n2 , based on entered values min2 and max2

n2 = rd.randint(min2, max2)

n2 = rd.randint(2, 8)

n2 = 2

7. Split equation into n2 parts by brakets randomly

f(x) = (aes(\[1\], x1) +rsa(\[22\],x2)+otp(\[34\],x3)+aes(\[12\],x4)) +(replace(\[45\], x5)+aes(\[243\],x6)+ceaser(\[255,11\], x7)+elipse(\[2,34\],x8))

8. Apply a random encryption or encoding function with math operation for each part:

f(x) = otp((aes(\[1\], x1) +rsa(\[22\],x2)+otp(\[34\],x3)+aes(\[12\],x4)), x9)+ aes((replace(\[45\], x5)+aes(\[243\],x6)+ceaser(\[255,11\], x7)+elipse(\[2,34\],x8)), x10)

9. Repeat Steps 6 - Steps 8 required number of times or random number of times

However, there is never an opening of the commitment in the proof - i.e. at no point is the commitment opened at a random point sent by the verifier like is done in KZG.

I understand how the proof is sound even without the opening. It's because part of the equation which is proved is computed from the trusted setup by the prover & the other parts computed by the verifier again using the trusted setup. And the trapdoors to ensure that the prover has used the Trusted setup - else the proof won't verify. 

I am surprised however, how this point (no opening) is not mentioned in either the paper or any other description of Groth16 considering this seems to be a rather non-standard way of using KZG type of commitments. Or is this usage not considered at all to be ""commitments"" & hence this is not mentioned - i.e. I interpret them as commitments only because they look similar to KZG but Groth & others don't look at these as commitments."

1533,Advice/suggestions on professional writing of controversial material?,4,1eogulu,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/1eogulu/advicesuggestions_on_professional_writing_of/,2,2024-08-10 06:54:46,"I’m in the same boat as many others (possibly you too) that disdains research/papers claiming to present “new”/“novel” things in compsci, especially cryptography, because the overwhelming majority of these papers:

* Are written from an excessively myopic perspective mimicking a novice who lacks sufficient real-world experience to understand the proper way some things are done. It’s easy to come up with new ideas and new ways to do things but it’s much harder to write real-world software systems and have a true appreciation for the way some things must necessarily work. 
* Extremely lacking in self-criticism, lacking in comparison to similar novel concepts that failed due to X Y Z, and lacking in how this novel concept is different from them
* Lacks source code for peer review/verification in the spirit of ""hey guys, just trust me on this”

All of that being said, I myself am embarking on writing a novel cryptography paradigm that imagines a new way to conceptualize encryption and follows this to its logical conclusion of an entirely new type of cipher unlike ARX, SP-box, Feistel, pseudo-hamad, etc., that’s in a class all of it’s own.

I am looking for advice/discussion to help me avoid common pitfalls with new/novel work. Some of the things I’ve thought of so far:

* Foremost, obey Schneier's Law!: hold out a glimmer of hope this work might be of some use to someone but anticipate I could be wasting weeks of effort on a trivially-debunked paradigm and cipher someone else breaks in 5 minutes.
* Significant emphasis on self-criticism! Lead with a most-conservative specific set of cases, circumstances, and conditions this work applies to and investigated usage in, explain how this work would be innapropriate for general usage or as a replacement for other encryption algorithms, etc. 
* The only thing claimed to be novel is the paradigm, not the cipher or any of the extensive followup work supporting the article. 
* Extensive recognition of existing work/techniques/concepts in cryptography and how these synergize, never conflict, with my new cryptography paradigm.
* Source code! In many languages! And lots of documentation and usages for everything and all the proper software goodies
* Judiciously limiting any broad generalizations to the absolute minimum, instead leaving these as exercises for the reader if they happen to think the same thing I do. Everything will be structured as concrete, formulaic, and ungeneralized as possible (while still indirectly hinting at the larger picture; I should be able to reserve that right, shouldn’t I?)
* Rationale/reasoning behind everything!, and cut out every nonessential aspect/detail that isn’t backed by a logical explanation of its necessity in the design.
* Structuring for skimability! 
* Real, concrete numbers and analyses on every angle/approach to cryptanalysis of my design that I can think of!

I’m eager for your suggestions and ideas to help me avoid common pitfalls writing a paper that presents new/novel work. My goal here in this forum is the same as my paper: to exchange knowledge and foster mutual learning.

I hope this question isn’t off-topic for this sub as I acknowledge Scheier’s Law, embrace being wrong, and seek only help on professional writing. No details about my specific topic or paper are mentioned here."

It currently uses AES256-CTR with pre-shared keys for communication. We’ve recently tightened the code-base up to work even harder to avoid IV re-use.

The project is squeezed by a few requirements, like the need for changes to be non-breaking if possible, the extremely slow data rates of LoRa, and the extremely limited ram and flash on many of the devices we support.

One of the known limitations with Meshtastic is that the keys are all PSK, and there’s no re-keying or forward secrecy for direct messages. Direct messages just re-use the shared channel key. I’ve jumped in to try to fix this.

I’m basing the effort on a drive-by pull request from a couple years back, that never went anywhere. The basic concept is to use a curve25519 diffie-hellman process. Part 1 of the DH calculation gives us a public/private keypair, and the node sends the public key with its node announce packets.

Then the remote node takes that incoming public key, and its own private key, and does part two of the DH exchange, giving it a shared secret. The current version of this code uses SHA-256 hashing step, as the raw DH result has “mathematical properties”. This hashed output will be used for AES-256-ctr encryption between the two nodes.



And here are the questions for the r/crypto brain trust:

Is a hashing step actually needed to evenly distribute the entropy of the curve25519 output, before using it as an AES key? I've not been able to find any work on how resistant AES is to that sort of problem. The original PR used a blake2b hashing step, but that overflowed the flash on some of our targets. I can just barely squeeze a SHA256 hash in, but if it's considered safe to skip, I’ll gladly do so, and have a bit more flash breathing room.

Are there any glaring flaws with this scheme? We’re not going to achieve secret-squirrel levels of encryption, but I’m trying to get this as right as possible given the constraints. You can find the in-development code at [https://github.com/meshtastic/firmware/pull/4379/files](https://github.com/meshtastic/firmware/pull/4379/files)

The older legacy crypto code is the more likely it will have such flaws.

No one wants to go through the effort of auditing that or rewriting that from scratch and sometimes the code itself is *very esoteric* (e.g. OpenSSL).

I am going to limit myself to certificates containing secp256r1 public keys and the TLS\_CHACHA20\_POLY1305\_SHA256 cipher suite for now.

This is my server certificate verify function:

    tls_record server_certificate_verify_record(
            std::string message_so_far_sha256, 
            std::string certificate_private) {
        sha256 ctx;
        ctx.update(std::string(64, ' '))
           .update(""TLS 1.3, server CertificateVerify"")
           .update('\0')
           .update(hash_verify_context);
        auto signature_digest = ctx.hash();
    
        std::string signature = secp256r1::DER_ECDSA(
            signature_digest, certificate_private);
    
        tls_record record(ContentType::Handshake);

        record.end_size_header();
        handshake_hasher->update(record.m_contents);
        return record;
    }

DER\_ECDSA is a function which takes the digest directly as a bigendian number (no further hashing) and performs a secp256r1 signature in DER format. I previously wrote a working implementation for TLS 1.2 and I am reusing the DER\_ECDSA function for its server\_key\_exchange record without modification.

The TLS client (cURL) successfully decrypts and decodes previous messages. It also decrypts and decodes this record and can tell that it is a certificate verify record and so I have confidence in my ChaCha20 cipher. However I then get a decrypt\_error alert from the client which means that the signature check is failing.

I am hashing (plaintext) records including (also tried excluding) the appended record type into the transcript. My server and client hello records were hashed to produce the handshake master secret which gives me mild confidence that I am correctly hashing records together for the transcript.

What other details might I be missing?"

Given the order of the finite field `p`

    p = 115792089237316195423570985008687907853269984665640564039457584007908834671663

        )

Which has the private key of `1`. 

Cofactor `h` is `1`. The equation is `y^2 = x^3 + 7`

We can find the `n` with **Schoof-Elkies-Atkin algorithm**

However, it's a bit confusing. [Here's the solution in Sage](https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/93679/how-to-calculate-the-order-of-secp256k1). It presents one code example:

        sage: p = 115792089237316195423570985008687907853269984665640564039457584007908834671663

What is `[0, 7]` specifically? These cannot be the coordinates of the `G`, since we already established that they are different.

And where in this calculation the `G` is even used?

What if we used instead of `G`, another point on the elliptic curve, that we know for sure that it sits on the curve and is part of our cyclic group. Like this one:

        (x,y) = (
        44886295857190546091508615621464465421050773292389158775895365558788257183826,

        )

The private key for this point sits somewhere between `2^129` and `2^130`. What would happen if we use this point, instead of `G` for our **Schoof-Elkies-Atkin** to calculate the `n` (order of the cyclic group)?

I have been researching which languages crypto libraries are used in production the most often. This matters to me because that means people are willing to trust the developers with their lives. And it seems FIPs-140-2 is a very important trait.

Here is a list of libraries that are at least mentioned on Wiki and that must have each see some use in production.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_cryptography_libraries

5/6 FIPS certified libraries are written in C. Why is that when C is plagued with code built on careless coding habits (no bounds checking for overflows)? Wouldn't make sense to publish FIPS libraries in Rust or C++ at least.

And of course it does not matter how much we complain about it. The developers are not going to change their language just because a newer language has more security features. But still--how come we are not seeing a growing list of FIPS-certified crypto APIs in more secure languages that businesses and governments can count on?

If the vast majority of crypto codebases are written in insecure languages like C why should we expect future crypto libraries to be written in safer languages? People new to the field need to study preexisting code, refactor it, and write their own code in said languages to get good at writing crypto code in those languages. But so far there is a serious shortage of production quality crypto code in safer languages that serves as educational material.

1572,"Transitioning from an existing stream-ciphered (TCP) stream to a TLS connection, keeping the same security assumptions",5,1eb5aad,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/1eb5aad/transitioning_from_an_existing_streamciphered_tcp/,7,2024-07-24 21:38:29,"Hello, I'm in the process of trying to optimise an applicative network stack by replacing an old school TCP stream of framed datagrams with a QUIC-based connection (between a client and a server). The TCP stream can be considered properly E2E encrypted and both peers are authenticated in the eyes of the other (no MITM possible at this stage). As a matter of simplicity and not changing what's already working, I want to keep the whole auth/encryption phase in the start of the legacy TCP protocol and optimistically upgrade to the QUIC-based one if both peers allow it, instead of immediately starting a TLS. Note that both servers/listeners (TCP and QUIC) are in the same process, so they have shared memory.

If I were transitioning from TCP to a new simple TCP stream (not QUIC), it would probably be sufficient to:

* have the client identify itself in cleartext in the new stream, possibly with a random value that was sent in the old stream by the server, so the server knows which encryption key will be needed
* immediately have both peers start conversing with symmetric encryption, using keys that were sent in the old encrypted stream
* I don't think any DH key exchange is necessary at all
* that's it! **Correct me if I'm wrong**

But in my case, QUIC is based on TLS, which is higher level than simple stream-ciphered TCP. Though I don't think I actually need any of this certificate chain/trust store stuff. I could simply have both peers generate a random self-signed cert to use them as simple keypairs, and omit every single metadata field (including the `SubjectAlternativeName` of the domain name). These certs would be sent over the old TCP stream by both peers, and then they would initiate a mutual TLS (mTLS) over the new QUIC connection. At this stage, the QUIC connection is encrypted between the same exact peers as the old TCP stream. **Does this sound correct? Am I making wrong assumptions? Is this over-engineered?**

A few notes:

* some certificate generation libraries require a domain name, so I could use an invalid TLD (RFC2606) like ""myprojectname.invalid"". It wouldn't be read anyway, as both peers check certs by strict equality/fingerprint.
* generating certs may be slow, in which case the server could generate a single one in memory, on startup, with a very high expiration date (or none, if possible in x.509), and reuse it every time. Clients would check its validity with strict equality with the one sent over TCP anyway, so the long expiration doesn't weaken security at all. Clients would probably still create one different cert per connection attempt, to make user fingerprinting harder. It shouldn't take more than a few millisecond to generate an EC key and that's acceptable on a client device

*Final note: I'm a bit of a newbie in crypto. I think I have a decent understanding of the general concepts, but it's pretty much 100% self-taught – and ""self-taught cryptologist"" doesn't sound great in a CV or a protocol definition document. I know that it can be easy to overlook MITM or replay attack vectors, and these are what worry me the most. Also none of this is for a very serious project, I won't lose any money or reputation if I'm given bad advice (but please don't* 👉👈)."

It basically says that wallets generated by BitcoinJs front end library from 2011 to 2015 are vulnerable because of the poor randomness generation. Especially those generated between May 4, 2011 to March 2012

But it's really vague on explaining what the actual exploit is. It could be just summarized as: *it used Math.random() for randomness before March 2014, and it is a bad function*

Let's look at the initial commit from [March 4, 2011](https://github.com/bitcoinjs/bitcoinjs-lib/blob/c0d740d2d4cd35ab18dc35e23936db42f17ad2ee) : eckey.js is used for generating the private key, while rng.js and prng4.js in the jsbn folder are used for harvesting randomness.

# rng.js

If `rng_pool` is not already initialized, it is filled with random values from `Math.random()`

    while(rng_pptr < rng_psize) {  // extract some randomness from Math.random()
        t = Math.floor(65536 * Math.random());
        rng_pool[rng_pptr++] = t >>> 8;
        rng_pool[rng_pptr++] = t & 255;
      }

`Math.random()` according to the [article](https://medium.com/@betable/tifu-by-using-math-random-f1c308c4fd9d) has the cycle of 2\^60 values before they repeat. The article also mentions that it [fails modern benchmark test](https://gist.github.com/mmalone/8b43c628c39cc39aa205), but I'm not sure about them

Is `Math.random()` the whole weakness of the story? What is the weakness actually about?

Later, the time in milliseconds is seeded to the pool

    function rng_seed_time() {
      rng_seed_int(new Date().getTime());
    }

And later for

    SecureRandom.prototype.nextBytes = rng_get_bytes;

we initialize the state, and pass the pool as the key into the RC4 cipher

    rng_state = prng_newstate();
    rng_state.init(rng_pool);

from prng4.js

# prng4.js

which creates a 256 values array

    this.S = new Array();

and fills it with the loop

    for(i = 0; i < 256; ++i) {
        j = (j + this.S[i] + key[i % key.length]) & 255;
        t = this.S[i];
        this.S[i] = this.S[j];
        this.S[j] = t;
      }

# eckey.js

eckey.js uses SecureRandom() and creates our private key

    var rng = new SecureRandom();
    ....
    this.priv = ECDSA.getBigRandom(n);

But again, this tells us next to nothing about the actual vulnerability and what attacks might be used. Unciphered's article suggests that if we have GUID or IV (I guess that's a public key?), then we can do the work with just 2\^32 to 2\^64 values (2\^48 most commonly)

Also, not sure about the clicks being added in the entropy pool, apart from:

`<body onClick='rng_seed_time();' onKeyPress='rng_seed_time();'>` comment.

In what way, other things are added into entropy pool apart from the initial timestamp seed?

*Edit July 23, 2024:*

Sorry, I forgot that [ecdsa.js](https://github.com/bitcoinjs/bitcoinjs-lib/blob/c0d740d2d4cd35ab18dc35e23936db42f17ad2ee/ecdsa.js) also has its own context

# ecdsa.js

Basically `getBigRandom()` method is realized in this file with `rng = new SecureRandom();`

    Bitcoin.ECDSA = (function () {
    var ecparams = getSECCurveByName(""secp256k1"");
    var rng = new SecureRandom();
    ....
    var ECDSA = {
    getBigRandom: function (limit) {
    return new BigInteger(limit.bitLength(), rng)
    .mod(limit.subtract(BigInteger.ONE))
    .add(BigInteger.ONE)
    ;
    },

1583,Best Crypto Libraries to Study and Learn From,13,1e73o7j,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/1e73o7j/best_crypto_libraries_to_study_and_learn_from/,9,2024-07-19 18:54:41,"Hello everyone,

I am struggling to research coding techniques for constant-time when programming cryptography. Of course a simple solution is study and read **the source code** from pre-existing crypto libraries.

Which crypto libraries would you recommend I study and learn from? The ideal crypto libraries are the ones whose source code is:

1. Easy to Understand
2. Constant-Time
3. Lab Tested to Be Secure Against Common Attacks (E.g. FIPS-validated)

The closest library I could think of so far is BearSSL since Thomas Pornin wrote decent documentation on constant-time cryptography and Multi-Precision Arithmetic.

What other such libraries do you recommend?"
1584,Question about Groth16 trusted setup & also about the Perpetual Powers of Tau Ceremony,4,1e6w0s2,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/1e6w0s2/question_about_groth16_trusted_setup_also_about/,9,2024-07-19 10:52:14,"This is the CRS generated by Groth16 Trusted Setup.

https://preview.redd.it/6j48x6a1redd1.png?width=515&format=png&auto=webp&s=48f10d930771d9ea0147e8ccb5342d551e4942b7

As per the moonmath manual this is a circuit specific Trusted Setup & I agree with the moonmath manual on this. If the number of gates in the circuit changes, then the full CRS changes.

&#x200B;

If you split this into 2 phases

\- Phase 1 - you generate the Powers of Tau for A & B (i.e. Powers of Tau for G1 & G2) & discard Tau as  toxic waste

\- Phase 2 - you generate the remaining things

However, there is a problem here - using just the Tau powers, you can compute every part of the remaining CRS except one part - the last part which I have marked in Red - the h(tau).t(tau) part.

This cannot be generated without knowing the value of t(tau) & the value of t(tau) changes if the number of gates increases or decreases.

&#x200B;

So why split into 2 parts - this is what I think is the purpose of splitting into 2 parts.

It's to enable the perpetual powers of Tau ceremony.

[https://medium.com/coinmonks/announcing-the-perpetual-powers-of-tau-ceremony-to-benefit-all-zk-snark-projects-c3da86af8377](https://medium.com/coinmonks/announcing-the-perpetual-powers-of-tau-ceremony-to-benefit-all-zk-snark-projects-c3da86af8377)

&#x200B;

In the above description of the Perpetual Powers of Tau Ceremony, I see the following

\> any zk-SNARK project can pick a round from the common phase 1

\> any zk-SNARK project can pick any point of the ceremony to begin their circuit-specific second phase.

&#x200B;

What I think this means is

\- Perpetual Rounds means Phase 1 doesn't stop.

\- In Round 1 of Phase 1, they generate a CRS for n gates - they generate a tau, compute the powers of tau & store it. They also compute Tn(tau) & store it along with it.

\- In Round 2 of Phase 1, they  generate a CRS for (n+1) gates - they generate a new tau from the older tau, compute the powers of the new tau & store the powers. They also store the newly computed Tn+1(tau) along with it.

\- In Round 3 of Phase 1, they  generate a CRS for (n+2) gates - they generate a new tau from the 2nd tau, compute the powers of the new tau & store the powers. They also store the newly computed Tn+2(tau) along with it.

&#x200B;

And so on & so forth - anything someone has a circuit with a higher number of gates, another round of Phase 1 is done. 

&#x200B;

Now if a zkSNARK with n gates wants to use the Phase 1 output, they use the Round 1 output, if they have n+1 gates, they use the Phase 1 Round 2 output & so on.

And since the output contains T(tau) also along with the powers of tau, the full second phase can be computed for that tau

Can someone who understands this, let me know if what I describe is correct? If it is not, how what is the procedure used which allows Phase 2 to be done without knowing the value of T(tau)?

I want to write some code to demonstrate a length extension attack on a homemade HMAC construction. Where a signature is constructed as:

digest = hash(key+ message)

and then I want to construct a digest from the output of those two.

I read up on it a little, and figured I could do a really simple small code example in c# (if anyone can help with snippets in other similar languages it would be really cool too :D )

**My approach**

  
So I figured that if I have a secret and a message that add up to the sha1 block length of 64 bytes, then the hash of these two would simply be a single block of hashing.

  
Then I could simply take the signature of this message, and append whatever to it, from which I would get a new hash, which would valid

And so I made this little snippet:



`using System.Security.Cryptography;`

`using System.Text;`



`// secret and message, together they are 64 bytes`

`string secret = ""secret222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222"";`

`string msg = ""data"";`

`// the digest`

`var digest = StringExtensions.hash(secret+msg);`



`// forging digest, simply trying to append ""appendeddata""`

`string append = ""appendeddata"";`

`// and now trying to forge a new digest:`

`var forgedPayload = StringExtensions.hash(digest + append);`

`// and then checking it` 

`var constructed = StringExtensions.hash(secret+msg+append);`



`public static class StringExtensions`

`{`

`public static string hash(this string input)`

`{`

`if (input == null) throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(input));`

`using (SHA1 sha256 = SHA1.Create())`

`{`

`byte[] bytes = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(input);`

`byte[] hashBytes = sha256.ComputeHash(bytes);`



`StringBuilder hash = new StringBuilder();`

`foreach (byte b in hashBytes)`

`{`

`hash.Append(b.ToString(""x2""));`

`}`

`return hash.ToString();`

`}`

`}`

`}`

  
However, this does'nt work. The two final hashes are always different.

  
What have i misunderstood, why are these values not adding up?"

Doing so allows the creation of subgroups of order 2, q, and 2q.

When a generator that generates the subgroup of order q is used for discrete logarithm, you lose half the possible outputs compared to the subgroup of order 2 but you also prevent leakage regarding the output from what I recall. The converse is true when you use a generator for the 2q order group(more outputs but you leak a bit of information). This means from a cryptographic perspective, both options are effectively similar(either q possible outputs or 2q possible outputs but you can exclude one half of the outputs due to leakage).

I would like to know if there would be any reason to prefer one subgroup over another for uses of finite field discrete logarithms in this scenario."

I have an Android App that stores encrypted data using a key derived from user entered password (PBKDF2). If any user forgets their password, they loose access to all their data. Hence, I am trying to implement a password recovery feature that is hacker resistant, including in cases where the phone may be rooted and the sqlite database is accessible.

Here's my solution. I randomly generate and store an internal password in the app. I then encrypt the user's password using this internal password using AES, and further encrypt the output and the user's email using my RSA public key. I store this RSA encrypted value.

If the user forgets their password, I submit the RSA encrypted value to my website. The website will decrypt the value using my private key and will email the app encrypted user password value to the email address found, as an attachment. On clicking the attachment, the user password is decrypted using the internal password, user is logged in and made to change their password.

Do you foresee any weaknesses with this approach? I guess if the user's phone is compromised, then the person holding the phone can check emails and retrieve the password. So perhaps adding a secret question and answer would help, but some people end up forgetting the answer to that as well."

`{ uint64_t Seed = *Seed0; uint64_t lcg = *lcg0; uint64_t Hash = *Hash0;`

    Seed *= lcg * 2 + 1;
    
    const uint64_t rs = Seed >> 32 | Seed << 32;
    
    Hash += rs + 0xAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA;
    
    lcg += Seed + 0x5555555555555555;
    
    Seed ^= Hash;
    
    const uint64_t out = lcg ^ rs;
    
    *Seed0 = Seed; *lcg0 = lcg; *Hash0 = Hash;
    
    return( out );

`}`

So, the basic PRNG with some, currently not formally-proven, security is as follows (XOR two adjacent outputs to produce a single ""compressed"" PRNG output):

    v = prvhash_core64( &Seed, &lcg, &Hash );
    v ^= prvhash_core64( &Seed, &lcg, &Hash );"

my idea is to use the pki for signing documents that can be verified later. the goal would be to ease the task of the verifier, not using some arcane formats, but something you can check with standard tools.

what i don't get is that certs expire. will the signature be meaningful after many years? assuming many items on the cert chain are now expired or revoked. the question is: was it valid at the time.

also, are there any tools to easily verify a document? something i can trust an average IT guy can do. it appears to me that openssl can do it in some steps, which is kinda acceptable.

is this even a good idea?"

I've now written a bit of code and have come to the point where I'd need to encrypt the files. My plan was to use asymmetric encryption where the secret key is encrypted using a user-provided password so that the user needs to decrypt the private key to view the screenshots taken / data extracted from the screenshots. 

I have now learned that asymmetric encryption is very slow and it's generally not designed to encrypt large chunks of data, so I'm not sure how to continue. Do you think asymmetric encryption is feasible for this? Any idea how else to do the encryption? Ideally I would like for the server that takes the screenshots to not have a key that can decrypt the files since that wouldn't be as secure. "

I can combine them with XOR to get c3 = c1 ^ c2, and somehow obtain a3 by some publicly known function f(a1, a2) 

Someone in possession of K, given c3, a3, iv1, iv2, should be able to verify that c3 is indeed composed of some XOR combinations of ciphertext that they have encrypted in the past. 

To be more precise, what I'm looking for is some kind of homomorphic encryption that respects XOR, which can easily be done with a stream cipher, but I'm also wondering if it's possible to preserve authenticity, at least as far as whether the ciphertext is composed of authentic ciphertext."

[here](https://www.programcryptography.com/post/rules-to-defend-against-fault-and-power-analysis-attacks).

Here is a summary of the attacks and defenses:

1. Power Analysis Attack: What Is It?
   1. Simple Power Analysis
      1. Random Noise: A Simple Defense Against Simple Power Analysis
      2. Masking: A Second Defense
      3. Montgomery Ladder: A Third Defense
   2. Introduction to Differential Power Analysis and Higher-Order Analysis
   3. Defenses Against Differential Power Analysis
      1. Higher-Order Masking
      2. Blinding for Public-Key Cryptography
      3. Perform Decoy Operations
      4. Montgomery Ladder
      5. Randomize Access to Confidential Array Values
      6. Operation Shuffling
      7. Non-Deterministic Processor 

Rules to Defend Against Power Analysis

1. Apply noise by executing programs in parallel on several CPU cores.
2. Apply masking. This can defend up to the nth-order differential power analysis attack. However, an (n+1)th order differential power analysis attack can bypass this defense.
3. If you are programming a public-key cryptosystem such as RSA or Elliptic Curve Cryptography you can use [~blinding~](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blind_signature) to protect the private key from power analysis attacks.
   1. You can blind the message itself.
   2. You *should* also blind the exponent used for encryption too.
4. Apply Decoy operations: calculations that *pretend to be authentic calculations based on secret data but are not in reality.*
5. Randomize Access to Confidential Array Values: Loop through elements of an array of secret values in random order.

1. Fault Injection Attack: What Is It?
   1. How Practical Is It?
   2. Why You Should Still Care About Fault Injection Attacks Demanding Physical Access
   3. Voltage Glitch Attack: A Practical, Remote Fault Injection Attack Targeting Intel Systems
   4. Electromagnetic Fault Injection Attack
2. Defenses Against Fault Injection Attack
   1. Use Nontrivial Constants
   2. Clear Variables After Use
   3. Search for Fault-Injection Resistant Implementations

In general, you can tell I really started to struggle to find techniques to defend against fault injection attacks. It is not well documented. Nevertheless my research tells me that Intel systems can be affected by voltage glitch attacks. These attacks can happen remotely and only cost \~$30 USD.

I also would appreciate any code samples of power analysis and fault injection resistant algorithms for common crypto operations. I think its a good idea we build a habit of programming our crypto APIs to defend against such attacks--especially in a world where we rely on someone else to do our computing for us (e.g. cloud computing).

Elliptic curves form a group over addition, but not (computably) over multiplication so no luck there.

Once you have both addition and multiplication, do you need anything else to operate meaningfully on data? Are there constant time algorithms you can’t perform? Is limiting yourself to constant-time algorithms too restrictive?

RSA unlike ECDSA operates on finite field elements where you do have both addition and multiplication. Discrete log is sub-exponential but still hard there. What’s missing for practical FHE?

ZKP QAPs can generalise useful computation with just addition and multiplication. Why not FHE?"

I need your help looking for a page about visualizing a brute force attack on either 128 bits or 256 bits (I can't recall exactly). I stumbled upon it some years ago and don't remember much about it. It may not even be online any longer. If I recall correctly, it was an analogy of a person talking with a bucket of dirt or water some large distance (perhaps across a country? Earth to Sun? Not sure). The analogy was approaching the infeasibility of brute forcing these insanely large numbers. It wasn't showing the impracticality via time though.

I'm familiar with Bruce Schneier's explanation on the [thermodynamic limits of brute forcing a 256-bit symmetric key](https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2009/09/the_doghouse_cr.html). I typically refer to this analogy.
Jeff Bonwick, the creator of ZFS, blogs about [boiling oceans with 128 bits](https://web.archive.org/web/20061111054630/http://blogs.sun.com/bonwick/date/20040925#128_bit_storage_are_you).

No program is vulnerable to timing attacks if its execution time is independent of any secret value.

1. When considering using a third-party library consider if the third-party library must manage secret information. If so check if the third-party library has been tested and verified to be constant-time. Most [\~do not\~](https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/1121.pdf)!
2. \~Only use secret information in a computation if the secret's value does not affect the system resources used nor duration of said computation.\~
3. Choose to use an algorithm that is designed to be constant-time in the first place!
4. Never use secret values to decide what code to execute next.
5. Never use secret values to determine which memory addresses to access.
6. Use ""unsigned"" data types to store bytes of data. Using the ""signed"" reserved keyword will cause the loss of the most significant bit in each byte!
7. Always generate random data from cryptographically secure pseudo random number generators. An excellent list of CSPRNGs may be [\~found here\~](https://cryptobook.nakov.com/secure-random-generators/secure-random-generators-csprng) in Nabokov's excellent guide on[ \~Practical Cryptography\~](https://cryptobook.nakov.com/).
8. Zeroize secret data *\~immediately\~* **after use. Check out Aumasson's secure coding guidelines for a list of** [**\~secure-wipe functions\~**](https://github.com/veorq/cryptocoding?tab=readme-ov-file#clean-memory-of-secret-data) **that do this.**
9. [\~Typecast\~](https://github.com/veorq/cryptocoding?tab=readme-ov-file#always-typecast-shifted-values) shifted values.
10. Any loop iteration leaks the number of iterations taken.
11. Any memory access leaks the address or index accessed.
12. Any conditional statement leaks which branch was selected.
13. You can assume how your CPU handles addition, multiplication, logical operations, and bitwise shifts are constant-time. Division is a unique case.
14. If you know a proof-assistant language such as Coq you should first make the program in a proof-assist language and compile that.
15. Use dynamic analysis tools against the final executable to test for constant-time. [\~Reputed ones\~](https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/1121.pdf) include and are not limited to: ""ctgrind"" (a patch of Valgrind by Adam Langley from Google), ""dudect"", or ""ctverify"".
16. If you can afford it allow a third-party to do a professional source code audit of the codebase."

However, the transport layer already has a mechanism for discarding malformed packets: decryption will fail.

If instead of using the UDP packet's checksum to detect many corrupted bits, it could use the checksum to attempt to correct a few bits.

This would improve network quality in noisy conditions (particularly non-civilian) where requesting a retransmission is slower or more costly than attempting error correction.

Error correction for UDP packets is pretty much brute force, and flipped bits in the checksum vs the payload are not created equal. So you would want to use raw packets with a dedicated error correcting code.

I am researching what math you need to program classical cryptography for a [book I am writing](https://helpthisbook.com/fosres/program-cryptography-volume-1-math-for-classical-cryptography).

Not all the math found in cryptography textbooks is required to program the cryptosystem itself.

From my research here is a list of the math you **must** know if you want to program cryptosystems:

1. Binary Arithmetic: You have to know how to add, subtract, multiply, divide, and get the remainder from binary division. The reason is you need to know how to do that to manage massive numbers stored in binary form on the machine. In addition to knowing how to do that for managing massive numbers you also need to know modular arithmetic, which is my next topic.
2. Modular Arithmetic: You have to be able to all elementary arithmetic and apply the result to the modulus operation (addition, subtraction, etc.). Modulus operations are found in just about every cryptosystem I have studied so far--from ciphers to hashes.
3. Multi-Precision Arithmetic: Public-key cryptography demands multiplying and even raising numbers larger than 64-bits in size by triple-digit numbers. We live in a world of 64-bit CPUs. When you need to store a number larger than what can fit in only 64 bits you have to split the binary representation across several 64-bit words and carry out the math operation across them.
4. Finite Field Arithmetic: Finite Fields are used in industry-standard ciphers including AES and in public-key cryptosystems such as RSA. Doing arithmetic with binary digit representations of finite fields, called binary fields, is mandatory to program such cryptosystems.
5. Prime Numbers: You \*have\* to know how to generate huge prime numbers. They are critical in protecting the secret key! There are efficient techniques for generating huge prime numbers. They are called techniques for generating ""probable primes""--numbers that are most likely prime based on a few numerical tests such as the Rabin-Miller test or Lucas-Lehmer Probabilistic Primality test.

I would argue the five concepts above are essential for programming cryptosystems. If there is anything I missed please comment below and let me know. Would love to hear from you!

TL;DR: is there any library for multivariate polynomial root finding over the integers?

I'm trying to implement an attack on RSA with known bits of p by using Coppersmith, such as shown in [this paper](https://www.iacr.org/archive/asiacrypt2008/53500412/53500412.pdf). In my case I have three blocks of lost bits, so it should be fine. The idea of Coppersmith is to first build and reduce a lattice, which is the costly part, and then convert some of the rows of the lattice back to polynomials that should have solutions over the integers that match the bits we're looking for. Finding the roots of a set of multivariate polynomials should have a very small cost when compared to lattice reduction.

However, I'm encountering a nasty surprise in my program. Lattice reductions take much (MUCH) less time than multivariate root finding, which is the limiting factor of my implementation. As of now I'm using a Sage script to solve the system, but it is too slow. Is there any library for integer multivariate root finding? At this point I don't care whether it's Python, C, C++, Fortran or whatever, I just want something fast that works for large integers.

Since my PhD will most likely have something to do with implementing cryptography I was thinking I would do something similar for my master's as warm up. 

My current idea basically is about finding curves that would do better than curve25519 in some (however niche) areas. For example, [optimal prime fields with low hamming weight](https://www.cryptolux.org/images/2/25/ICCSNT2011.pdf) seems to offer very good performance on 8-bit and 16-bit microcontrollers. Surprisingly I don't think anyone has tried to standardize a 128-bit security curve on such prime fields yet, so I was thinking maybe I can find a curve based on such a field that satisfies the SafeCurve criteria, implement it for atmega128, do some benchmark with existing x25519 implementations and see if mine is better. Although I'm not really confident about this idea since I might've just missed some work that people have already done on this topic, or there's something fundamentally wrong with this idea since I'm not really an expert in microcontrollers or optimized implementations.

Since my university doesn't have a huge cryptography faculty, I'm seeking advice from y'all on the subreddit. Do you think my idea would be good for a thesis or do you have any other ideas? Thanks!"

So from that one could expect perhaps a roughly 50/50 usage ratio. CFB seems to have some significant advantages. It requires no padding and is not susceptible to IV prediction (BEAST). So historically it seems we would have been better off for SSL/TLS if it had been based on CFB rather than CBC.

Something I have just recently learned, CFB is nicer in that the IV only has to be unique (you could use a counter). CBC requires a random IV. The interesting thing is that the NIST document was wrong about this in that it claimed the IV characteristics were the same between the two.

I understand the performance advantage of counter mode, this question is just about CFB vs CBC.

I understand the theory (mostly) but my attack doesn't produce the correct subkey, even when provided with all the traces in the dataset. I'm not sure where I'm going wrong but I have a few suspicions:

* The traces only record one round of AES, not the entire process. I'm not sure if this is an issue as the theory doesn't make it clear whether the entire trace for the AES operation is needed or if it's okay to have just one round, but it could cause issues.
* The points of interest that I'm selecting are not appropriate. I'm not really sure how to rectify this besides using another method (I'm currently using the difference of means method and I have seen that there are other methods available, e.g. sum of squared differences or PCA).

Zero knowledge proofs operate on gigantic polynomials, that are known by both prover and verifier.

Can both parties just agree to work modulo x^700 - 1 for example?

Real world zero-knowledge provers require 100s of gigabytes of RAM and are painfully slow.

Extending this, the verifier could specify the exponent N. They could even specify a dozen exponents and get a dozen proofs to really capture the constraints of the problem."

[https://medium.com/@VitalikButerin/quadratic-arithmetic-programs-from-zero-to-hero-f6d558cea649](https://medium.com/@VitalikButerin/quadratic-arithmetic-programs-from-zero-to-hero-f6d558cea649)

You start with some problem f(**y**) = 0, where y is some group of values and f could be just about any problem, maybe 'find a set of values y\_i for the squares in this Sudoku', or 'Hash(y) - hashVal'

You want to convince someone you know **y** without revealing it.

You convert f() into a 'recipe' of very steps, 'add y\_a and y\_b to get val1' then 'multiply val1 and y\_b to get val2'.

List out those steps as a series of constraints:

y\_a + y\_b = val1

val1 \* y\_b = val2

etc.

Now as the prover, actually input the value of **x** you know to get the values for val1, val2 etc.

Produce a big secret vector s of all inputs and intermediate values that appear in the constraints (1, y\_0, y\_1, ... y\_n, val1, val2, val3 ...)

Construct a giant matrix equation of the form

As . Bs - Cs = **0**

where rows of A and B have one or two non-zero values, and rows of C have one non-zero value, and '.' is a element-wise product.

Multiply this out to get the constraints back, to double-check you didn't mess up.

Each row i = {1, 2, 3, ... n} encodes a constraint.

We now replace the matrices with polynomials (a + bx + cx\^2 ...)

s.**A**(x) \* s.**B**(x) - s.**C**(x)

We check we didn't mess up by inserting values of x = {1, 2, 3 ... n}, which, by design, should give us our list of constraints back, and evaluate to 0.

Z = (x-1))(x-2)(x-3)...(x-n) evaluates to 0 when x = {1, 2, 3 ... n}, and so we can set the right hand side to be some polynomial times this

s.**A**(x) \* s.**B**(x) - s.**C**(x) = H(x) \* Z(x)

We now divide by Z(x) to get H(x) + some remainder.

If the remainder is non-zero then something went wrong. Does that mean that if the remainder *is* 0, then we can present the polynomials, A, B, C, H as a zero-knowledge proof that we knew **y**?

Verification starts by constructing the constraints from f(), check that they match A, B, C.

Then what? The verifier doesn't have access to s to verify the equation.

What can we give the verifier to verify the equation? I'm not fussed about keeping the proof succinct or performant. I'm just learning. Something intuitive but maybe broken is the checkpoint I need"

F1600 is not uniquely invertible, it is nevertheless invertible: from an output, you can calculate some input that produces that output.

If you start from some hash, fill out the rest of the F1600 state arbitrarily and try to perform this inversion, you’ll get an input where the last 256 bits of the state are not 0 and so this input is not an allowed preimage.

The χ step of the inversion gives you freedom to set specific bits in the f1600 input. If we could just figure out some set of choices here that sets the 256 end bits of the ‘input’ to 0, we have a way to create SHA3 collisions!

The signature can be verified because the public key's hash is part of the Wi-Fi password. This is meant to improve security in network where the Wi-Fi password is shared to many users and is basically public knowledge.

But what stops an attacker from setting up an AP without SAE-PK enabled, or even with WPA2? How does the client know the network is supposed to be protected by SAE-PK, if the only information it has is the SSID and the key, aka Wi-Fi password?

The function/algorithm which achieves defense against differential attacks must be different from the function/algorithm who uses the key.

Btw, this principle actually exist in AES (so it isn't really something new).Of course, the order in which this functions/algorithms are applied is: first, the one that achieves defense ; second, the ones that uses the key.The difference between this encryption system and AES would be that if the first function is positively provable than there is no need for multiple rounds.First i would choose plaintext size = ciphertext size = key size = 8192 bits.

In my opinion, the second function (the one that uses the key) is pretty boring; basically it can be any function that respects all properties of One Time Pad.Some specific example of such functions are:

1. XOR operation (my preferred choice)
2. modular addition/subtraction

For the first function (the one that achieves defense) i'm thinking about a simple function that flips 4097 bits for each bit changed/flipped inside the plaintext.The starting/default (plaintext ; ciphertext) pair is (000...000 ; 000...000) pair.Btw, it is easier to count the positions from 0 instead of 1.If bit (from plaintext) on the position i is changed/flipped. Than all bits (from ciphertext) from the positions:\[i ; (i +4096) modulo 8192\] closed rangeare changed/flipped.

The question is: What are the weaknesses of this symmetric encryption algorithm (knowing that you can encrypt as many blocks as you want using the same key in ECB mode of operation) ?"

1. Manufacturer, e.g. ASUS
2. The cloud provider, or owner of a host machine which contains a TPM manufactured by ASUS, call her Eve
3. The relying party, Bob

The short of what I'm trying to understand is this. Supposing Bob trusts ASUS the manufacturer, and does not trust Eve, can Bob be assured that Eve is running an application he created as is, with nothing else?

So suppose Bob is developing some web application, call it Survey Ape. Bob makes a build for Survey Ape and loads it into a custom linux image so that if he puts that image on his own HDD it will load linux and auto-start Survey Ape. He sends that build to Eve to run on her host machine. I think the TPM can be used to assure Bob that Eve is in fact running untampered ASUS hardware. But can the TPM attestations also be used to assure Bob that Eve did not modify the linux image before loading it into the hard drive, perhaps changing Survey Ape to harvest credentials?

Suggestions for further reading are appreciated."
1747,Looking for learning resources for CSIDH,15,1bwsq0y,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/1bwsq0y/looking_for_learning_resources_for_csidh/,8,2024-04-06 02:20:35,"Hello, recently I came across ""A Friendly Introduction to Supersingular Isogeny Diffie-Hellman"" to SIDH by David Urbanik [(link)](https://www.math.toronto.edu/dburbani/work/friendlysidh.pdf). His explanation was very digestible for a layman like me and gave a very clear overview on how SIDH works.

I'm currently looking for something similar but for CSIDH. Many papers on CSIDH assume too much mathematical background for me which makes it very difficult for me to understand what's happening. Does anyone know of a high level overview of CSIDH that assumes a similar mathematical background like Urbanik's?

Particularly, from what I understand, CSIDH works by commutative group action where the group is isogenies acting on some elliptic curve E0. What I'm confused is:
1. How are the isogenies constructed?
2. How do isogenies even compose and commute: say I have phi: E0 -> E1 and tau: E0 -> E2, how would (phi . tau) even makes sense, let alone being equivalent to (tau . phi), when the domains and codomains don't even match?
3. An extension to 2: what even is the group? I can't convince myself isogenies would form a group under composition since composition doesn't make sense. 
4. Wouldn't algebraic actions like this be suspectable to quantum attacks? Or is it okay for CSIDH specifically because we aren't sending group elements, but rather elements which is being acted on by a group?"

But when I checked the Veracrypt user manual I was shocked.veracrylt says we shouldn't use their encryption/ hidden volume on SSDs and USB Flash drives as its uses  wear levelling mechanism. So data leak can happen and their encryption also will not be implemented properly.
So there is no use in encrypting and creating hidden partition in usb flash drives, but people are blindly blaming even fips rated secure flash drives and praising veracrypt.
Don't they know this issue?

I am trying to perform some EC arithmetic on the [secp256k1](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Secp256k1) curve. 

Specifically, I am having trouble performing a modular multiplication using [Hashcat’s OpenCL implementation mul_mod](https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/blob/fafb277e0736a45775fbcadc1ca5caf0db07a308/OpenCL/inc_ecc_secp256k1.cl#L593) function.

The function as-written is for performing modular multiplication `mod P`, but I am needing to perform modular multiplication `mod N`. I previously tried to modify the function to use the lib’s `SECP256K1_N*` values, but was not getting the proper result. 

I noticed that the function uses an optimized algorithm from [Modular Multiplication using special prime moduli](http://www.isys.uni-klu.ac.at/PDF/2001-0126-MT.pdf) (p.354 or p.9 in that document), and as such uses a “magic number” from the curve (omega: `0x3d1`) related to the curve’s P value in the internal calculations. 

Is there a straight-forward way to alter this function to perform multiplication `mod N`? Or, is this specific implementation not compatible due to the “special moduli”? If not compatible, can someone help point me in the right direction of an OpenCL compatible mul_mod secp256k1 implementation?"

On top of that, could you guys maybe enlighten me. Is there a reason, why this topic is usually not worthy for an own sub-chapter? Is it a trivial thing or is it just too vague?

Why padding oracles? I am interested in having some literal content, other than the same explanations on the internet. Don't get me wrong, they are good and helpful, but while learning for my crypto exam, I often realized, that I want to go the extra mile.

motivation: bank releases a signed document about your monthly transactions. you want to show it to someone, but redact certain fields.

kinda something like this:

bank has a signing key, the public key of it is PUB

the bank signs a document m that is a series of submessages m_1 ... m_n. the bank also publishes S signature.

then i can redact any of the messages, and construct, e.g:

m_1, redacted(m_2), m_3, ..., and a modified S'

anyone with S' and PUB can verify the redacted signature against the redacted m.

it is okay if S' has a totally different format than S.

it should be clear and verifiable which parts are redacted and which parts are original.

the parts must still be linked together. so individually signing parts is not enough.

however, it should not be feasible to figure out any redacted elements, even with brute force. this is important, because m_i can be of a small set, like birth year, or can be guessable, like a suspected recipient bank account number."

I have a question about data encoding for various FHE schemes. 

I've read the original CKKS paper, and as I understand, with CKKS, we have to use canonical embedding encoding procedures to encode our data into polynomials from Rq, which means that with degree-N polynomials, we can encode at most N/2 numbers. 

I have a couple of questions
 Are there other encoding schemes for CKKS with better encoding efficiency? 
What encoding schemes are used by BGV and/or BFV? What is their efficiency? 
What other encoding schemes exist, and what schemes use them? 

Thank you!"

One for comparison/authorisation and the second is a key for encrypted data.

Is this a safe use-case?

I personally think so due to the fact the only way you'll get the second hash is if you brute-force the first one which would ultimately mean they have your password.

At the moment I just wanna be safe, thank you for your advice!

Specifically, I have set of parties (which must be scalable to more than two!) who each will possess a share of a mutually-unknown secret key which cannot be revealed safely. Instead, I need to reveal the result of hashing the key XORed with some extra data; indeed, the entire point of the multi-party computation is to ensure that as long as there's one non-colluding party, the key cannot be derived. The most obvious approach seems be to use fully homomorphic encryption, but that is (usually?) a symmetric system where whatever key which can decrypts the output data could also decrypt the input, which must remain secret.

I have some design leeway, and while I prefer a low-communication solution, I might instead be able to use a protocol like MP-SPDZ's `tinier` FKOS15 implementation over a bitsliced boolean circuit -- except that I've tried three different circuits and can't get a test vector to work in any of them. (That part might just be because I suck. Pointers appreciated.)

I'm also tantalized by the idea that the fact that the compression function is itself constructed entirely from simple boolean operations (AND, XOR, NOT, and rotate right) might mean that it's in the set of functions which can be efficiently handled by the method described in [Secure Computation on the Web: Computing without Simultaneous Interaction](https://eprint.iacr.org/2011/157.pdf), but I have no idea if I'm barking up a sensible tree there.

currently playing around with X25519/chacha20  (and its AEAD counterpart chacha20poly1305) to do some PGP-esque  encryption stuffs [here](https://github.com/seanwatters/rgp/blob/main/src/lib.rs#L125).

based on my understanding of stream ciphers, ""nonce  reuse"" refers more specifically to ""nonce reuse with a given key, for  different plaintexts.""

basically the thing that i'm trying to  evaluate is whether there is any risk to ""reusing"" a single nonce with a  bunch of keys that are guaranteed to be random.

the process for encryption is as follows:

1. Generate one-time and ephemeral components
    - nonce      
    - one-time content key      
    - ephemeral private key      
    - one-time public key 
2. Sign plaintext to generate content signature
3. Encrypt plaintext and content signature with one-time content key
4. Encrypt one-time content key for all recipients
    - Generate shared secret with recipient public key and ephemeral private key
    - Encrypt one-time content key with shared secret

in the current setup the ""content key"" (think PGP session key) is always randomly generated, and the Diffie-Hellman shared secrets—used to encrypt the ""content key"" for each recipient—are created with an ephemeral/throw-away private key that's also randomly generated (and if you have a duplicated public key in your recipient set, it's still same-key-for-same-nonce-for-same-plaintext so no violation).

additionally, if there was somehow an overlap on a recipient's DH shared secret and the content key (statistically very low likelihood) i'm not sure that there is any additional vulnerability, or way to analyze without having already either gotten the content key or the shared secret, and in either of those cases you're already in.

NOTE: this whole thing is mostly just about saving storage space; ideally just wouldn't have to store an additional 24 bytes per recipient. with benchmarking, the time overhead of generating a nonce for each recipient is negligible."

I'm working on a file hosting service (think s3) one of which's goals is storage deduplixation between clients. Files are identified by their hashes, and currently every client must re-upload the entire file to prove ownership. We're trying to move to a model where files aren't not re-uploaded using some kind of Proof of Retrievability.

Ideas we've come up with:
1. Generate a secret per file at first upload time, and generate an HMAC using that secret and file. Store secret and HMAC. Provide client with secret at upload time to allow them to generate the HMAC and present it as PoR.
2. Classic merkle tree.
3. Generate hash list (basically merkle tree leaf nodes but no tree) and store with file. Request entire hash list as a PoR from client.

Our security team shot down 1 since they thought a shared secret (even though it's on a per file basis) between clients is bad. We decided against 2 because it's too much of a burden on our clients. We're implementing 3, but tbh it just doesn't sit right with me.

Do any of you have thoughts on some kind of alternative PoR that has the ease of use of the hash list or HMAC, but allows each challenge to be unique? Additionally, we ruled server side spot checks or dynamic HMAC secrets since it's too expensive to read from storage.

My real interest is in pushing the limits of what we can do with them, such as using it for fuzzy data (ZK biometric proofs) and maybe even geometric ZK-proofs which could be used to prove flight paths without giving them away.

The answer I usually get is that it's much easier to find a solution when the operations are out of group.  I've never seen though the effort to prove to me entirely why.

This example public key algorithm is an out of group RSA variant and thus far does not have any solution that breaks it.

Generate 4 primes not equal (a, b, p, q)

n = p \* q

m = a \* b

t = ((a - 1) \* (b - 1) \* (p - 1) \* (q - 1)

pk = random integer such that GCD of integer and t = 1.

sk = modular inverse of (pk, t)

if n < m swap n and m

Encryption and decryption are achieved with 2 exponentiations.  Encryption m first then n, decryption, n first then m.  Signing and verification are achieved similarly to RSA signing modulus order (m, n) verification modulus order (n, m).

What makes this a good or bad public key algorithm?

I'm currently playing with my [Tkey](https://tillitis.se/products/tkey/), which for our purposes is basically an HSM. Among other things, I would like to use it to sign huge multi-gigabyte files. Unfortunately my beloved TKey has less-than-lovely specs:

- A very slow RV32I CPU running at 18MHz).
- An even slower 62.5K bauds serial connection.

Hashing my 4GiB file on the TKey would take forever, and streaming it would take even longer. What am I gonna do?

## The boring solution

Well duh, don't sign the file, sign a hash of the file instead. And if that's not good enough there's Ed25519ph (Pre-Hash) that can do the job for you, RFC approved and all. There's even [direct support for it in Monocypher](https://monocypher.org/manual/ed25519), just use that and your tiny TKey won't have to hash the whole file.

## The clever solution

No no no, that's not good enough. I want a _pure_ Ed25519 signature, of the _entire_ file. When there's a will, there's a way, so let's try to be clever and [hope for the best](https://monocypher.org/quality-assurance/disclosures).

Hem.

First, a recap of Ed25519. Starting from a secret key `sk` (a random 32 byte number) and a message `M`, the whole signature thing goes like this:

    t1 = SHA-512(sk)[ 0..31]
    t2 = SHA-512(sk)[31..63]
    a  = trim_scalar(t1)         // Secret key
    A  = [a]B                    // Public key
    r  = SHA_512(t2 || M) % l    // Secret nonce (l == curve order)
    R  = [r]B                    // Public nonce
    h  = SHA_512(R || A || M)
    s  = (h*a) + r
    -> R || s

As for signature verification:

    assert(A is on the curve)
    assert(R is on the curve)
    assert(s < l)
    h = SHA_512(R || A || M)
    assert([8*s]B == [8*h]A + [8]R)

The first problem with Ed25519, is how signing requires _two_ passes over the file. My TKey's puny 128Kib won't hold my 4GiB file, so not only do I need to hash it twice, I need to _stream_ it twice. But you'll notice that the first hash has one purpose and one purpose only: deterministically generate a random nonce between 0 and the curve order. The main reason for the determinism is to avoid the dreaded ECDSA nonce reuse, and be immune to bad RNG. The TKey has a good RNG, so let's rely on that:

    t2 = random(32 bytes)
    r  = SHA-512(t2) % l

_(Note that I don't trust my TKey to generate perfectly unbiased random bytes, so I use a hash to smooth out any irregularity.)_

Now I only need one pass:

    h = SHA_512(R || A || M)

Note how this is derived from public information only. It has to be, since that's the hash used for verification down the line. Which means I can compute it on my host laptop, which got gigabytes of memory and gigahertz of speed. How about doing just that?

    TKey:
        r = SHA-512(32-random-bytes) % l  // Secret nonce
        R = [r]B                          // public nonce
        -> r

    Laptop:
        h = SHA-512(R || A || M)
        -> h

    TKey:
        t1 = SHA-512(sk)[0..31]
        a  = trim_scalar(t1)              // Secret key
        s  = (h*a) + r
        -> s

    Laptop:
        signature = R || s
        assert(signature is valid)

So it looks like it works, right? Well…

## Is it secure?

It clearly is secure against eavesdropping, because only public information ever goes to the wire (except when you sign private files, but that's out of scope). Potentially more worrying is a compromised client or full blown MitM. My TKey is supposed to act as an HSM, so I need to guarantee it won't leak its secrets even if I get ransomwared by the NSA and KGB combined.

Note here that we have exactly three pieces of private information inside the TKey:

- __sk:__ the Ed25519 secret key.
- __a:__ the actual secret key (enough to forge messages).
- __r:__ the secret nonce.

The TKey outputs 2 pieces of information we could use to trigger a leak:

    R = [r]B
    s  = (h*a) + r

That is, the signature itself. Which is okay as long as `h` is legitimate, but a compromised client would actually have full control over `h`. So what if we replace `h` by some malicious value?

    s = (0*a) + r = r
    s = (1*a) + r = r+a

In the first case we leaked the secret nonce r. Which would be catastrophic if we could trick the TKey into reusing that nonce, but making sure the TKey uses each nonce for at most one signature is easy. I'm more worried about the second case. Sure, if we have only one it is quite clear we cannot disentangle `r` and `a` from just knowing `s`. But what if we try this several times?

    s1 = r1+a
    s2 = r2+a
    s2 - s1 = r2 - r1
    ...

You get the idea. I _think_ this kind of shenanigan is not enough to recover information about `a` (because of the similarity with stream ciphers), but I'm still afraid I might be missing something.

Hence my question: __is my scheme actually secure, or is there a way to get secrets out of my TKey from a compromised laptop?__"

I understand the basics of the purpose of a rainbow table and how a cryptographic hash function (e.g. SHA-2) works and which properties it has.

I keep stumbling over the vague description of the required reduction function. My understanding about rainbow tables so far has been:

&#x200B;

* I have a list of many possible passwords (P)
* For each of these passwords p from P, I first calculate the hash value `h(p)` and then reduce it using a reduction function r. The result is a chain of length 1. This can be repeated many times to get longer chains
* The result of a chain of length 1 for the first password in my list is: `r(h(p_1))`
* The reduction function is usually chosen in such a way that it maps a relatively ""long"" hash value to a value that corresponds to the domain of the original password list P. So `|h(something)| > |r(something)|` and `|r|^character_set` is approximately as large in bits as the number of passwords in P, right?

So far so good. Now, however, this value r is hashed again at some time in order to be able to generate longer chains.

If I assume that the hash function h is a one-way function, I don't understand what information is gained here. If I hash a value y that is only minimally different from value x, the resulting hash value for cryptographic hash functions changes by 50% on average (avalance effect). So how can I gain any additional information from `h(r(...))`?

I can´t see the benefit from a rainbow table since i don´t get how a further hashing of a somewhat arbitrary reduced previous hash gives me any advantage since any input to a hash function that is different than the original will give me something completely different what looks like random-ish."

1. As an example, if given a 256 bit hash function, I assume that there is a 1-1 mapping of all 256 bit inputs to different 256 bit hash functions.
2. For inputs longer than 256 bits, the hash value of all possible inputs of the same length provides a uniform distribution over the 256 bit hash space.

But I've stumbled upon some sort of a block in undestanding...

Universal hash function's collision estimate is commonly defined as N/M, where N is the number of unique keys, and M is the capacity of a data structure (or hash output, if a hash-map is used). For example, in this lecture: [https://www.cs.cmu.edu/\~avrim/451f11/lectures/lect1004.pdf](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~avrim/451f11/lectures/lect1004.pdf) or on Wikipedia, but there it's much harder to read.

However, as I know from practice, collision estimate for all modern hash functions, from non-cryptographic xxHash to cryptographic SHA and Blake is (N\^2)/M/2. This can be seen in SMHasher tests.

So, the question is - what an ""acceptable"" universality proof should prove - N/M or (N\^2)/M/2? N/M can probably be seen in CRC32 or some linear mappings, but these are not considered ""state-of-the-art"" hashes, and I can't prove this for \`komihash\`. Proving the latter can probably be done via birthday paradox and correlation reasoning as \`komihash\` is basically a pseudo-random permutation with validated high-quality PRNG performance.

EDIT: it was my misunderstanding - N/M relates to pair-wise collisions. While (N\^2)/M/2 is set's total collisions estimate, unrelated to isolated pair-wise collisions, and is not defined in ""universal hashing"".

EDIT2:  I've just found an answer myself. If a data structure is filled with values from S iteratively, one by one value, and each addition causes N0/M collisions on average, where N0 is the current number of values in a data structure, then the integral of the number of collisions from 0 to N0 is N0\^2/M/2, for ""universal hash function"", and it cannot be anything else."

I'm from IT background but I know very little about cryptography.

&#x200B;

Issue: I'm new to Cryptography. I've been trying to learn cryptography for quite a long time. I joined many courses so far from University to paid courses, the issue with many of these courses is

&#x200B;

The way they teach is stuck on single Powerpoint slide and speak the whole lecture which is very boring, non interactive. The professor or teacher in other courses assumes the student knows it all and skip definition of many things.

&#x200B;

The solution I'm looking for is :

Is there any course out there (from verified sourse not any random youtube video) that teaches cryptography from the scratch, just for beginner, at a very basic level, and teach in an interactive manner like using animation.

&#x200B;

**\[ Update \]**

I couldn't understand the long courses (I attended many of them) which aimed at beginners but they explained cryptography terminologies in brief in just 1 sentence and move on..

Then explain different encryption without explaining in detail what the basics are and also without explaining, the terminologies in detail for ex: I attended a few courses that just went off my head.

&#x200B;

So I decided to attend the Introductory course but I'm yet to find the one I'm looking for, I'm sure I'll get that. I prefer paid course as they tend to add value and I'm open to attending more than one (if you've any suggestions).

&#x200B;

FYI: At present, I don't want to go for practical things as I first want to understand the very basics, literally elementary level basics (to go up to beginner level) so that I can understand. Once, I found a course that aimed to children but it was too short and ended in 7 mins.

&#x200B;

I just want to learn the very basics in very easy to digest manner like:

history of cryptography and 

followed by different ways of cryptography, 

how it's used (for ex different types of encryption) in a very easy language and with interactivity as I mentioned earlier.

&#x200B;

Is there anyone know what I'm looking for? Thank you in advance 🙂"

1845,Does my research proposal make sense?,11,18dztif,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/18dztif/does_my_research_proposal_make_sense/,5,2023-12-09 05:00:39,"Hello, I'm seeking opinions for my PhD research proposal related to cryptography and type theory. My idea is to create a framework in Agda (a proof assistant) for universal composability proofs. This is largely motivated by the fact that most cryptographic proofs aren't rigourous and is on paper. If there is a framework for mechanizing UC proofs then we can guarantee that the proofs are actually correct with a lot less effort, and also ideally lower the entry for people who want to formally proofs their protocols are secure.

My university happens to have a lot of experts in formalizing pi calculus, so my plan is to:
1. Formalize ""interactive polynomial time turing machines"" with pi calculus in Agda
2. Make some helper lemmas and functions to help with actually doing UC proofs
3. ???
4. Profit 
5. Maybe try to actually use it by translating some proofs from paper to Agda, like the OPAQUE proof

My questions are:
1. Are there communities online that are experts in universal composability proofs? It would help if there's a Zulip / Discord / Slack group where I can ask more in-depth questions.
2. I know there are people in University of Boston who are also trying to mechanize UC proofs with EasyCrypt. That said I haven't tried EasyCrypt at all, so I don't actually know how it works. They said they needed to create a DSL specifically to reduce boilerplate code, so I'm guessing EasyCrypt's expressiveness isn't that good and perhaps a more expressive proof assistant like Agda would be a better choice. Does it make sense to try to mechanize UC proofs in Agda when there are already people doing this with EasyCrypt? 
3. Somewhat related to (2), but if anyone here knows EasyCrypt would you mind sharing your experience using EasyCrypt to formalize cryptographic proofs? How difficult would you say it would be to use EasyCrypt to model more abstract stuff like simulation based proofs?"

Right after going through introduction to cryptography, I'm putting it into practice, mainly to learn.

For instance, I wanted to try out cascading encryption.

I was using ascon and XChaCha20-Poly1305 (as an introduction to fast/lightweight algorithms).  The keys for both are generated just before use, from hashes, say, user password hash, combined with hash of something else.  I used argon2 to get the hashes (extracted the actual random thing from inside of what argon2 generated).  The two hashes are joined by addition, say, in python, hash1+password\_hash.  The result is hashed with ascon.hash with ascon-xof, to get a final hash, which is to be used as key

`key = ascon.hash(hash1 + password_hash, ""Ascon-Xof"", 64)`

Key is never saved anywhere. Neither is user password hash (or password). For hash1, either the actual hash, hash1, is saved or some random thing, from which hash1 is to be generated, is saved.

The question is about key generation. For each, ascon and xchachapoly, different hash1 are combined with the same user password hash, (say, ascon\_hash1 + phash, xcp\_hash1+phash), to generate different keys of required lengths.

Is generating key like this bad? How bad?

The question actually originated when I was about use an actual KDF, HKDF, and figured it is going to be pain in the moola if I use any more libraries. But if the above is stupid, I will use actual HKDF.

Ps. I'm still learning, the above is not for real world project but a prototype.

It might have been first realized in 1985, but to see it practically explained and ready for implementation was mind blowing *(I mean, all cryptography is basically wizardry anyway!)*. I immediately jumped right behind it and followed everything about it. I was able to read the paper, understand some of it, and see the building consensus amongst researchers as to its efficacy. The open discussions were illuminating.

Around that same time I learned of the new applications of forward secrecy in communications protocols too, like OMEMO or Signal. Cryptography was killing it! Solving problems, saving lives, helping people through transparent research and open source application of number theory – this is what makes it all worth it!

Then in 2018 I heard about some improvements in homomorphic encryption and immediately fell in love. It was basically promising the ability to perform computations on encrypted data without needing to decrypt it first. That’s huge! Of course everyone around me said *“That’s just theory, there’s no way it will work in practice. It’s decades away, if ever”*, but it was open source, research was continuing transparently, and you could understand that even though there were differing approaches / schemes, everyone wanted it to work for the benefit of everyone and there was a lot of passion for it.

The recurring theme to the positive effect of these advancements in cryptography and applied cryptography that I'm talking about here were that they were made possible because of open, published research, and transparent, open source applications. We all know that while being open doesn’t guarantee something is secure, being closed kind of guarantees it can’t be.

This applies to all cryptography of course, but as FHE is just now starting to really explode, I feel it’s important for us to demand substantial evidence or peer-reviewed research of any FHE solutions. The complexity of FHE makes it challenging for non-experts to distinguish between legitimate advancements and fraudulent claims – even for other cryptographers who aren’t studied in FHE –  so we as a community need to speak out as we have done before with *“not your keys? not your crypto.”* except now *“not open? not secure”*. You don't need to be an expert in homormophic encryption to know that someone claiming ""*it works, but you have to trust me*"" or ""*watch this demo but we can't show you any code*"" isn't good enough.

Everyone here knows this and I'm preaching to the choir, but I feel like it can't be stated enough so I wanted to make this post. We really should demand tangible evidence supporting any claims made about FHE products or technologies, and we should demand they allow independent verification of their efficacy and security. The research behind it should also be made public and subject to peer review.

We all care about cryptography and the promises it holds for protecting and advancing communications and information and thus civilization as a whole – that’s why we’re all here – but ""*Not published? Not secure! ""*"

Now let's say you want to use additional data when verifying the JWT in a manner similar to an AEAD. This additional data should not be disclosed by the JWT. And this is not supported by your basic JWT library. How would you do that?

Encoding the associated data with [PAE](https://github.com/paseto-standard/paseto-spec/blob/master/docs/01-Protocol-Versions/Common.md#authentication-padding) seems like a good first step. 

Then it's possible to include a hash of this encoded associated data to a ""aad"" field within jwt data (in the payload probably). Verification then comports two steps, first verify that the JWT is properly signed using the library, then verify the associated data hash in that JWT. But I dislike that we've now split our security verification in two steps that depend on each other, even if I can't find a way to exploit it at the moment. It feels error-prone.

It also discloses a hash on the associated data, which isn't desirable if it is composed of guessable information. This is fixed either by adding a nonce to the associated data (but now we also need a new ""aad-nonce"" field) or using a HMAC with a server secret instead of a regular hash for the ""aad"" field. Having a server secret goes against many uses of JWT so it's probably not a great idea.

If the JWT signature uses HMAC instead of RSA, then we can maybe include the associated data in the key. Something like: hmac_key = pbkdf(pae([associated_data] + [hmac_secret])). But that approach gives some amount of control over the HMAC secret which is the foundation of our security in this JWT scenario, which isn't great. And it's impossible if RSA is used.

So all in all it seems the best is to add two fields to the JWT:

* ""aad-nonce"" with a nonce
* ""aad"" with SHA384(PAE(associated_data))

followed by a two-step verification.

What do you think? Do you know of any library that proposes associated data natively with the JWT? Do you see any flaw in that design?

I'd like to say that this is just to play around, but I'm currently looking at code that tries to do JWT with associated data in an obviously broken way so I'm trying to see if it's feasible to fit a replacement in an existing architecture or if deeper changes are required."

I currently have no real knowledge of programming, encryption, electronics, radio (beyond signal propagation fundamentals), or any other concepts and/or processes required to see this project through to final development of a functional product/prototype. I would also like to note that I am interested only in building this and NOT buying a commercially available device of comparable capability. This is primarily to ensure personal control over functionality and develop a fundamental understanding of all processes involved in the project.

The concept is an inline encryption/decryption device that is intended to be connected to a digital radio. On the transmitting end, it should take the voice transmission from the digital radio, encrypt it, and then transmit it over RF. The receiving end decrypts the transmission and forwards it to the connected radio. This is intended to allow the end user to dictate their own encryption methods for digital radio rather than relying on manufacturer encryption standards.

I would like to eventually expand this device's capabilities and make it able to send encrypted text and other data over radio as well. I would like it to be capable of functioning as a standalone device when transmitting text, but must require connection to a radio to transmit voice.

Unfortunately, I do not even have limited knowledge to start with. I know nothing of the concepts or skillsets required to begin creating such hardware and am seeking advice or even assistance on where to start. I may even be willing to make the final product open-source or seek partners/codevelopers in the development process.

Please understand I am only seeking advice and assistance regarding tackling this project. I am not interested in the opinions of Sad Hams who will argue ""legality"" of encrypted signals on amateur radio frequencies. This is not intended to be used on amateur radio frequencies.

Any help will be greatly appreciated."

&#x200B;

I'm aware we work in a cyclic subgroup of curve25519 for obvious reasons, the curve is composite order, with groups of 1, 2, 4, 8, q, 2q, 4q, 8q.

&#x200B;

1, 2, 4 & 8 are obviously tiny and useless.

2q, 4q & 8q are not interesting as composite and can be attacked with PH.

&#x200B;

I think that the reason we clamp the key is to ensure we are always using a key that is a multiple of 8 so we always end up working in q.

&#x200B;

A few questions:

&#x200B;

1. If we always used the regular G as generator, we would always end up in q anyway right? (even without the key being a multiple of 8), so this only matters for ECDH, where maybe G is not the only point used for scalarmul?
2. does this mean that the actual valid private keys are literally always multiples of 8, i.e. 8, 16 ... 2\^252 - so all keys between 1 and 8 would yield the same public key? (appreciate in reality we use 32 byte keys, but hypothetically) if your private key was: \`\`\`0x0000000000000...1\`\`\` or \`\`\`0x0000000000000...7\`\`\` you'd get the same pub key after clamping + scalarmul, right?
3. If 2 is true I guess this is ok as q is really representing only 1/8th of the points on the curve?

*Elligator is a way to hide a cryptographic key exchange using elliptic curves as random noise, devised by Daniel J. Bernstein, Mike Hamburg, Anna Krasnova, and Tanja Lange.*

This was prompted after reading [How the Great Firewall of China Detects and Blocks Fully Encrypted Traffic](https://gfw.report/publications/usenixsecurity23/en/). What I've come to realise is that crude measures are taken for applications that do encryption - GFW doesn't have a DPI that's distinguishing poionts from random strings, it's instead trying to drop any communication that indicate likeliness of high-entropy throughput indicating encrypted streams.

Are there implementations of censors where they've implemented inspecting traffic and performing point distinguishability of strings for a putative handshake and not considering the traffic a concern if it is indistinguishable from random?"

I’m interested in mathematical cryptography, including the theoretical design of cryptosystems and the study of mathematical problems that are related to or “one step removed” from cryptography, e.g., in algebraic number theory and algorithmic number theory. That said, there are basically no faculty working in cryptography at my university—hence my focus on pure math instead—and so I’m turning here for domain-specific advice.

I have a few questions, and would really appreciate any insight anyone in the field could give, even if only on one of the questions.

1. Does anyone have recommendations for programs and/or particular professors to look for? From my searching it seems that relatively few researchers in mathematical cryptography (in academia) are in the US, whereas I’ve found many in Canada (Waterloo, mainly) and in Europe. There are a few I’ve found in the US—Kirsten Eisentrager (Penn State), Katherine Stange (CU Boulder), some at USF and FAU as well, and some more junior faculty at Virginia Tech. Are there any other particularly notable programs I should consider besides these? (Or any of these I shouldn’t really consider?)

2. To what extent does the overall academic reputation of the grad school matter if my goal is to pursue a career in research? I know that in principle what matters is your research, but I’ve also heard (more informally) that it can sometimes be difficult for hiring committees to completely ignore where someone did their graduate work, and that has made me (perhaps wrongly) a little wary of places like FSU and FAU. 

3. Would it be a bad/risky choice to go into isogeny-based crypto now, given the attack on SIDH from last year? Or is it still an active area of research that’s attracting funding?

Thanks very much for reading! And if anyone has any other advice/comments unrelated to these questions (or related to questions that I should have asked but didn’t), I would very much appreciate those as well."

At the outset, I thought, it's meant to reduce the over all TCB in a security protocol? For example, we can do the keyed mac verification using a public key and so don't have to establish the key for it. However this uses asymmetric key crypto and so doesn't quite into what I described above. Also the performance won't meet the symmetric key based protocol/computations. 

From the RFC -- ""A key application of the VRF is to provide privacy against offline
   dictionary attacks (also known as enumeration attacks) on data stored
   in a hash-based data structure.  In this application, a Prover holds
   the VRF secret key and uses the VRF hashing to construct a hash-based

1940,Novel Hash Based PoW Key Exchange,4,15wrkas,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/15wrkas/novel_hash_based_pow_key_exchange/,1,2023-08-21 05:42:39,"Hey everyone. Long time lurker and security buff with a hobbyist specialization in cryptography. To put it in perspective, I've studied secure coding and practiced proper implementation of cryptographic primitives (i.e., how to handle a password, various algorithms, salting hashes, CSPRNG vs PRNG, and things on that level). I've only just come up with this idea in the last couple days so please excuse a few potential errors. This is not a finished system. Also, all of this is written on mobile from memory.  Please let me know if I went off the wall somewhere and I'll review it.  I mainly want to get opinions and discuss my approach using hashing and PoW as a key exchange algorithm. 

With the goal of securing a connection (tunnel) from point A to point B, I have been developing a rough draft proof of concept that will allow both parties to mutually exchange a set of secrets as proofs of work. As with DH, this is susceptible to a MitM attack. It's important to note that this is designed to establish a mutual, genuine interest in the secure connection, but only guarantees the integrity of the connection. It will limitedly ensure confidentiality, but only if the first few handshakes aren't recorded and solved by a bad actor.  This means that a connection can be intercepted after the fact with no repercussions, but an attacker with logs of the entire exchange session will be able to solve the PoW and create a MitM-like scenario

The handshake works by forcing both parties to brute force the hashes of randomly generated values to arrive at unique proofs of work. They are effectively authenticating each other's interest in creating this session.  They share the completed proofs and, if valid, they continue brute forcing in segments until both secrets are complete. 

Each party generates a unique, random secret S and hashes N bytes of S before exchanging the result. Ideally this will include a random salt, integration of connection details into the hash, and timestamps.  The mutual challenges are passed if both parties return valid hashes of the (ideally modified) plaintext solutions. This repeats for all bytes in both secrets. As N increases, so does the computational cost of the handshake (256^N hashes max with 256^N / 2 being the average hashes needed to solve the proof for N-byte chunks). 

This process expends time and energy to make eavesdropping costly to an attacker. It also reinforces the relationship between points A and B since they are both performing work to support the connection.  A MitM would have to do twice the work to arrive at the same secrets. 

Even with full knowledge of the parameters, the attacker would need to perform the same brute force attacks as the legitimate parties. There is no way to coerce the secrets without solving the hashes. Again, I know anyone with knowledge of the full session can perform the same work (perhaps more easily) but the same potential exists with DH as well. If an attacker tries to do this across multiple sessions, they will be expending that much more energy to breach just one layer of security. This can be further enhanced by adding a static number of hashes to be done on the final step, and/or using a memory-hard hash function like scrypt. 

This is my first post and entirely on mobile so cut me a little slack lol. Thanks!"

A signature attached to an image (or other) file, that proofs that the image was created by human craft.

The signature should be able to verify that the image was created by a human considering how much work was done within some creation software using some verified hardware and how much intervention from other sources the image had (like copy from external source into the image).

Since my knowledge  about crypto is almost non existent, here is a rough and clumsy description: creation software (like krita) could have an add on that “records“ all movements within the software and hash it so it can be used to verify the  how the work was done. This signature should also consider a hardware key implemented within creation hardware like wacom in a way that the only way to fake the image using machines is to have a robotic arm trained to behave like a human and spend the time a human will take to create the image, holding a stylus and using a wacom tablet painting in krita in a way a human would.

Do you think it’s applicable? Can someone with a better understanding about crypto give me a more accurate description about how it could be accomplished from a technical point of view or point me where I could study about systems like this?"

For this example, think of public keys **Pub** as private keys **Priv**, (private scalars), one-way converted to points on the elliptic curve.

**n** \- is the order of the group. Private keys can range from 1 (the generator point **G**) to **n−1**.

**n−1** is the maximum size (integer value) of a private key, and it is also the number of all non-trivial points available on the curve.

The order **n** itself produces the point at infinity **n ∗ G = O**. Adding points further, just starts the curve over again.

As each public key has its own corresponding private key, that corresponding private key lies within certain ranges of powers of 2.

The order itself lies within: 2^(255) < **n** < 2^(256)

Suppose that we have a public key **Pub** that corresponds to the private key **Priv** whose range is known. Like: 2^(a) < **Priv** < 2^(b)

Before using a certain formula, we need to create 2 arrays

1. An array of 256 public keys. Each public key will represent a private key that will be powers of 2 ranging from 2^(0) = 1 (the generator point) to 2^(255)

2) Another array of 256 public keys, with each public key representing private key that contains: 1 + (1 over the power of 2 ranging from 2^(1) to 2^(255)  ). Note: B\[0\] is going to be 1 + 1 = 2. Like:

The formula allows us to do this:

Imagine we have in addition:

2^(a) < **Pub** < 2^(a+1)

2^(b) < **A\[b\]** < 2^(b+1)

If **a = b** then:

If the **Pub+A\[b\]** hasn’t crossed the n boundary, the result should be 1 or 2. Otherwise, it has crossed the n boundary

If **a > b** then:

Let's review specific examples (Had to use links for some images):

1. a = b ([https://i.stack.imgur.com/b0EOb.jpg](https://i.stack.imgur.com/b0EOb.jpg))

Let 567 be our unknown private key converted into the public key. 2^(9) < 567 < 2^(10)

Let 637 be a public key that we add. 2^(9) < 637 < 2^(10)

2) a > b ([https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZupFE.jpg](https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZupFE.jpg))

For example, we could add the number that is 1 power of 2 less than our public key. Our public key corresponds to 2^(9) < 567 < 2^(10), and we add the public key of 2^(8) < 325 < 2^(9)

3)  a < b ([https://i.stack.imgur.com/rSHp8.jpg](https://i.stack.imgur.com/rSHp8.jpg))

Let's add the number that is 1 power of 2 higher than our public key. Our public key corresponds to 2^(9) < 567 < 2^(10), and we add the public key of 2^(9) < 1058 < 2^(10)

Imagine if we have a curve of order of n = 33 151. 2^(15) < 33151 < 2^(16)We'd like to add 67. 2^(6) < 67 < 2^(7). However, if the addition result of 2 public keys is bigger than the order of the elliptic curve, the count starts again. We could have our original private key to be **n − 1 = 33150**. Hence, **33150 + 67 => 33217 − 33151 = 66**

Let's apply the formula. In other settings:

However, in settings of our elliptic curve, 33150 + 67 becomes 66

We didn't get an expected result, and hence we detected a cyclic group crossover.

But in practice it doesn't work. I've been experimenting with SECP256K1 additions. For example, if we take **n − 1** as our original private key converted to public key then:

When **(n − 1) + 3** we'd get a public key of **2G**.

Have no idea why.

In other words, why does the method work with decimal (normal) arithmetic, but with ECC additions, it doesn't? Is there any way to fix it?

By maximal degree, I assume he means that the opening time depends on the size of the Reference String - the tuple size depends on the highest degree of the polynomial you want to commit.

1974,Lets design a provably collision-free hash function.,4,14rgual,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/14rgual/lets_design_a_provably_collisionfree_hash_function/,21,2023-07-05 22:39:55,"The pigeonhole principle dictates that any collision-free hash function will produce an output digest whose length in bits is equal to the length of the input message.  Whatever function we implement, H(M), will be a bijection, and therefore any output digest `D=H(M)` will uniquely determine its paired input M.   

The properties of our H() which we desire are security, arbitrary input length, and a good avalanche effect.  Security means it is prohibitive for an attacker to surmise the message M, given its digest.  Avalanche effect means any small change in M results in a catastrophic amount of change in the bits of the digest.   Finally, arbitrary input length means that the length of M determines the output length -- in our case, exactly so.   

The uses of such a hash function are numerous :

+ You run a company that issues prepaid cards of some kind or another. Every card must have a unique access ID number, but consecutive access IDs give no indication of what IDs could occur in the future.  The IDs should be unpredictable even if many hostile customers horde thousands of cards and collude with each other.

+ You run a website with user-uploaded content.  You must automate the file names in your database of uploaded files, but in such a way that all filenames are unique.  You might desire the next file names are consecutively *unpredictable*  , to avoid directory crawling or other abuses of your system.

+ You need a substitution table for largeish words.  A bijection function is mathematically equivalent to a substitution table over words. If your word size is 32 bits, a substitution table would be a file of 16GB. Worse, if you have a word size of 64 bits, the table could never be stored on earth. Instead, you can use your collision-free H() to calculate this table ""on-the-fly"", on a word-for-word basis, without the need for storing the entire table.  You simply input your word into the function and it calculates the ""substitute"" word forwards. 

It may come as surprise that off-the-shelf cryptographic hash functions offer no guarantee of resistance to collisions. In many contemporary algorithms, it is merely anecdotal that no collisions have ever been found.  In contrast, the collision function described here is *provably collision free.* However it will utilize some famous hash functions internally. 

For brevity, we will denote the hash function CFHF(M), operating on input message M.   CFHF is best described for very long M first, and then modified to its shorter versions, which are significantly more complex. We will impose a simplifying constraint, that M must come in specific whole number of bytes. So CFHF has arbitrary input length, provided the input length is a multiple of 8 bits.   A final constraint is imposed that the smallest input length is 16 bits. Generally the input size is unbounded above.


# Large M

For larger M exceeding 64 bytes,  CFHF is mostly trivial.  We remove the leading 512 bits of M and set it aside.  The remaining portion is concatenated with a secret key , K.   This concatenated string is taken through a known hash function that outputs 512 bits.      The output of the hash is XOR'd against the leading bits of M set aside from earlier, and then slapped onto the end of the output block.    The remaining portion in the input (after the leading) is a copy , unmodified, at the beginning of the output block. 

The above procedure repeats recursively in several rounds, eventually where the final output block is the digest of CFHF().    

This large M case is shown in the following diagram over one round : 

https://i.imgur.com/thC2Qri.png

The corresponding pseudocode 

	-------------------------------
	|| ; concatenation operator
	M  ; message 
	""Mn"" ; denotes the nth iteration of M. Same length as M.  
	K  ; secret key .  the zero byte if not desired. 
	Hs() ;   SHA512 , WHIRLPOOL or similar. 
	rounds <-- 6  ;  (discuss?)
	for n <-- 1 .. rounds : 
		V <-- first 512 bits of Mn
		R <-- trailing bits of Mn after 512. 
		T <-- Hs(  R||K ) 
		Mn <-- R || (T xor V)  
	D <-- Mn
	Output D
	-------------------------------

While SHA512 is chosen here, any can be used (WHIRLPOOL, Skein, etc).

# Collision free? 

A heuristic proof that CFHF is free of collisions is to run the following algorithm on many (message,digest) pairs produced by CFHF.  The following pseudocode will recover M exactly given only its output digest, D.   

Note this procedure assumes the length of M exceeds 65 bytes.

    ------pseudocode of inverse function of CFHF()----
	|| ; concatenation operator
	D ; digest from CFHF above. 
	""Dn"" ; denotes the nth iteration of D. Same length as D.  
	K  ; secret key matches CFHF above.  
	Hs() ;   SHA512 , WHIRLPOOL or similar. 
	rounds <-- 6  ; (discuss?) 
	for n <-- 1 .. rounds : 
		V <-- trailing 512 bits of Dn
		R <-- leading bits of Dn not containing V 
		T <-- Hs(  R||K ) 
		Dn <-- (T xor V) || R 
	M <-- Dn
	Output M
    -------------------------------

Since M is always exactly recoverable starting from a digest alone, we argue (heuristically) that  the hash function must be a bijection.  Bijections are not merely collision *resistant* -- they are by definition free of collisions entirely. 

We turn to the discussion of whether CFHF really is collision free but in the mathematical sense.   We note that if SHA512() is chosen for Hs() , that there is no guarantee of collision resistance.  

Indeed, it must be the fact that collisions will occur in T, as the secret K key was concatenated to R.   It turns out this does not matter.  To prove this to the reader,  simply substitute a static T in the above algorithms. Substituting a constant T would correspond to maximal collisions in Hs(). Literally all inputs to Hs() collide.   Notice that M is still fully recoverable from D.   

Thus we conclude that  CFHF is still collision-free,  even when Hs() is not.


# Medium M

A medium length M is  17 bytes up to 64 bytes in length.  This special case is required as the chopping of the leading 512 bits leaves nothing left in the trailing section.   Given that the key K is still concatenated, we still implement SHA512, but then use MD6 to ""compress"" the digest.     Now instead of chopping 512 bits on a leading section, we chop 128 bits instead.  

A diagram of one round is shown here :

https://i.imgur.com/FHgp6Xg.png


# Small M 

As before,  the procedure of chopping off 128 leading bits will degenerate when the entire input message is less than 128 bits.   Some other procedure must be used.  CFHF() becomes most complex in this regime of inputs, and a block cipher is recruited in one of the steps.    Instead of chopping off a fixed-length leading section,  we now partition M into two left and right halves of equal length. This is always possible since M's length is constrained to multiples of 8 bits, and has an even length.

The diagram for one round is shown below :

https://i.imgur.com/2Pz2qSW.png

Some brief words on the decision to include a block cipher here.  It was required that the trailing bytes undergo a compression function.  The computer science literature is saturated with variations of how to 'hash' a larger string to a smaller one, due mostly to an abstract data structure called a *lookup hash table.* Those procedures were serious candidates here, as in this regime we may have M messages which are only a handful of 6 to 10 bytes or so.    However, those procedures are woefully insecure in the cryptographic sense.  

We opted instead for a different approach. This proceeds by first expanding the trailing bits to a 128bit block, via MD6.  This block is then subjected to a block cipher and then literally truncated by taking the first j bits and discarding the tail.  The reader may note that this procedure is technically implementing (what could be called) an arbitrary-length *compression function.*  For tiny M of 2 bytes, a block cipher is overkill. But this is the price paid for generality. 


# Implementation 

Constraints are imposed on CFHF() for simplicity. Input message must be in bytes, and the smallest message allowed is 2 bytes.  As far as the question as to how many rounds are suggested, the answer would nominally be six rounds.   Technically the number of rounds required is a convoluted function on the length of M.  These complications are simply academic.  A simple, straight answer is sufficient : use six rounds.    


# Weaknesses

For any designed hash function,  the desired avalanche effect has that if a single bit is changed in M, then (roughly) 50% of the bits change in the output digest. 

CFHF  exhibits a ""weak"" avalanche effect for extremely long M.  The reader may have noticed that if M is longer than say,  1600 bits,   then if a single bit is changed in M, the number of bits that change in the digest is maximally 512 bits.  Their location may even be identifiable in the digest.  This number then remains flat for M's longer than 1600.  

It may be that increasing the number of rounds heals this weakness.  It is not clear whether this is true in practice, and this space is ripe for research."

And I came across this article: https://words.filippo.io/dispatches/age-authentication/

After reading this my understanding is that signing is probably necessary if you are going to backup your secrets file to a cloud provider. Because otherwise they could just completely replace your file and you would never know.

The article also talks about something called **signcryption** and mentions how no popular tool does it. The author claims this is necessary because combining signing and encryption is hard.

> If you encrypt and then sign, an attacker can strip your signature, replace it with their own, and make it look like they encrypted the file even if they don't actually know the contents.

> If you sign and then encrypt, the recipient can decrypt the file, keep your signature, and encrypt it to a different recipient, making it look like you intended to send the file to them.

I am not really sure I understand the above statements because this should be applicable to GPG also right? Does GPG have the above problems?

Can I simply use AGE and maybe another signing tool like SIGNIFY to do what I want as an alternative to GPG?"

1. For my purpose, should I use GF(256) or GF(2\^8) or any other GF? Are the same or what are their differences?
2. Why do people use different GF for secret sharing? What are their differences and impacts using these different fields?
3. How do I decide and choose the right field to use in most cases?"

It is entirely open source, the existing readme explains the basic algorithm, and I am currently working on improving documentation that explains the stronger version (to help mitigate against short-circuit brute force attacks). I would be thrilled to give more info and answer questions, including my opinions on the nuances of the implementation.

After many hours of searching patents, the approach is novel AFAICT, though I have been able to find one existing patent, [""Message encryption using a hash function"", 1993, Kaufman & Perlman, DEC](https://patents.google.com/patent/US5483598A/en), that uses recursive hashing for dynamic creation of 1-time pads. There are key differences, let alone the lack of parameterization and configurability in the patent. Most of these differences rely on the knee-jerk reaction that the algorithm is ""inefficient"" as it operates at the hex level (i.e. not binary), when IMO the definition of ""efficiency"" always depends on the use case. My particular use case is to minimize complexity to be friendlier to our emerging DLT infrastructure and the future of smart contracts (though it's not directly related to cryptocurrency!). Also I offer it as an alternative to existing post quantum approaches for diversification, though of course that would require cryptanalysis beyond my current abilities. At the very least, it should be trivial fun for people who enjoy examining algorithms.

As for some of the other requirements before posting, I have certainly been aware of Kerckhoffs' principle for decades. Schneier's Law is newer to me but seems I imagine to be born of practicality with moderating forums above all else. I am not saying my system is unbreakable - far from it. That's why I'm looking for constructive external feedback, in good faith and friendly, from those with more cryptanalysis experience than me, including help pointing me to prior art.

## algorithm tl;dr

The [encrypt-gib readme](https://github.com/wraiford/encrypt-gib/blob/main/README.md) has a better walkthrough, but the fundamental idea is that instead of working at the binary level we work at the hex level. We encode the plaintext into hex, and then we use mostly recursive hashing to create ""JIT alphabets"" (similar to on-demand 1-time pads) *and substitute the character with its corresponding index into its alphabet.*

## example output

## weakest stream cipher

Here is an example of the weakest form that enciphers character by character.

With the encrypt-gib repo cloned and using node v20 (v19+ required b/c I use `globalThis` for easy isomorphic Web Crypto API usage):

    node . --encrypt --data-string=""foo"" --output-path=""./bar"" --strength=""weaker""

So `""foo""` is the plaintext, this will write to a file called `""./bar.encrypt-gib""` and `""weaker""` specifies a relatively arbitrary set of weaker parameters. Using the password of ""bar"", this produces the output in `bar.encrypt-gib`:
    {""encryptedData"":""3,2,8,16,89,9"",""initialRecursions"":1000,""recursionsPerHash"":2,""salt"":""3dcf8b601d59509f5608323d00d5077929a70544e17f9a5fb47cd7093b145704"",""saltStrategy"":""initialAppend"",""hashAlgorithm"":""SHA-256"",""encryptedDataDelimiter"":"",""}

_Note that it first hex encodes the plaintext, which is why there are more numbers in the ciphertext than characters in the plaintext._

## stronger multipass parameters

The most obvious weakness with the stream cipher approach, even with a higher number of initial rounds of key stretching (`initialRecursions`), is that it would be relatively easy to brute force offline if you know the shape of the beginning of the plaintext. For example, if you know it's a JSON object, then the first character should be `""{""`. When guessing, you don't need to decrypt the entire data, just the first couple characters should suffice.

To help mitigate this, I implemented a [""multipass"" mode](https://github.com/wraiford/encrypt-gib/blob/90cec1697863db4a1cd987df3d8231f3e2b7a5c1/src/types.mts#L124). When used in combination with an [`AlphabetIndexingMode`](https://github.com/wraiford/encrypt-gib/blob/90cec1697863db4a1cd987df3d8231f3e2b7a5c1/src/types.mts#L61) of `""lastIndexOf""` and a ""sufficiently high"" pass count, this creates a couple interesting dynamics. It forces the decryption to work over the entire section, as each 1-time alphabet is only extended once per section pass. So if there are 3 passes and 3 hex plaintext characters `""abc""` in the section, the alphabets would be built A, B, C, AA, BB, CC, AAA, BBB, CCC. So there is a relatively high probability that the last index of `""a""` will not be in the first hash digest alphabet. This also has the interesting quality of placing the alphabet-building phase in memory, creating a possibly memory-hard algorithm.

## thanks

There are many more implementation details of course, but I feel I've already written more than enough here. Of all the research I've done, I can say that this has qualities *like* those involved in many existing systems, e.g. a Feistel network. But the only thing to my eyes that looks really close is the ""Message encryption using a hash function"" patent, though again that works at the binary level. The fundamental reason I like this particular approach is that it leverages cryptographic hashes as a whole to reduce and/or concentrate complexity. For just one example, this turns out AFAICT to mitigate against timing attacks ""for free"". But since this works at a high level, it obviously has a performance bloat. I'm wondering if further cryptanalysis by experts would show that it is fundamentally flawed or that it would be a big, slow - but effective - cousin of the new encryption algorithms out there.

Thanks for your time."

And when it came to cryptography, I never learned why the algorithms worked, I simply learned the algorithms and applied them. Not because I didn't want to, but because I really had no time to understand them.

The only book that seems to delve into the intuition of why the math works is Cryptographic Engineering. It's the only book that delved into the number theory in detail. But having one resource, kind of, isn't ideal. I really like supplementing reading materials."

This works much in the same way keys for Bitcoin wallets can be deterministically derived from a recovery phrase.

As far as I'm aware, Mnemonikey is the first of its kind, rhyming only with the related but conceptually different [`passphrase2pgp` tool](https://github.com/skeeto/passphrase2pgp), from which I drew my original inspiration.

This first release marks a point which I feel is suitable for a v1 release, but before that I'd first like to send out some feedback requests in various communities to ask for final feedback and, for those most interested, testing of the library and/or CLI tool.


[Y'all were extremely helpful when I made my initial feedback request](https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/zoezpt/mnemonikey_determinstic_backup_and_recovery_of/), and by now the ripest fruits of that feedback have been implemented. Notably:

- [The seed and creation time is hashed with Argon2id before deriving keys, to reduce the feasibility of a batched brute force attack.](https://github.com/kklash/mnemonikey/pull/19)
- [The epoch has been bumped to New Year 2023.](https://github.com/kklash/mnemonikey/pull/24)
- [We are now using a custom 4096-word list](https://github.com/kklash/mnemonikey/pull/26). This allows for denser encoding, and provides word-to-word distance guarantees.
- [Added support for password-encrypted recovery phrases.](https://github.com/kklash/mnemonikey/pull/28)
- [Added a `convert` command to convert recovery phrases between encrypted and plaintext formats, and to change the passwords of encrypted phrases.](https://github.com/kklash/mnemonikey/pull/33)
- [Added a script to construct static, reproducible builds of the `mnemonikey` CLI tool.](https://github.com/kklash/mnemonikey/pull/36)

Basically I'm reading [this paper by the NTRU Prime team](https://ntruprime.cr.yp.to/latticerisks-20211031.pdf) and in section 2.5 it's explaining how cyclotomic fields should be replaced with prime degree fields with ""big Galois group"", namely because how structures within cyclotomic fields (e.g. subfields and automorphism) can potentially lead to an attack in the future, it then states ""Fields with big Galois groups are far from having automorphisms.""

This sentence confuses me because to my understanding a Galois group is the group of all automorphisms in a field extension, so wouldn't a ""big Galois group"" imply having a lot of automorphisms? 

It also goes on to state how NTRU Prime field has a Galois group of size p!, whereas NTRU field's has size p-1. How exactly does the size of the Galois group correlate to security of the KEM?

I'm excited to introduce you to a project I've been working on in the past weeks: Sequency.

Sequency is a lightweight C++ library that makes generating random numbers effortless. Whether you're designing a game with unpredictable elements, or a simulation that requires robust randomization, Sequency is can empower your project.

**Project:**

 I wrote Sequency with the intent of creating a very easy-to-implement and light PRNG library. As we can see, there are crypto libraries like OpenSSL which make everything too overly complicated for simple applications; Sequency is designed to be simple and effective. 

**Contributing:**

Contributing to Sequency is super simple, in fact, my initial intent was to have a lot of people contribute to it for its semplicity. So yeah! I'd really really really like contributions, whether they're new algorithms, documentation improvments, code comments or anything else!

I'd love to see people contribute to my project with complicated PRNGs like  Rijndael or MARS in CTR, ISAAC, Fortuna or any other algorithm!  
Feel free to contribute, suggest, or criticize my work!

For more information about Sequency and how to use it, you can check out the project on [**GitHub**](https://github.com/JoshuaKasa/Sequency).

Does anyone know if there exists online a collection of actual Enigma messages, together with their decryptions?  I've found perhaps half a dozen examples online, mostly taken from salvaged submarines. 

I'm organizing a cryptography course, and I thought it would be a good exercise to write a simulation of the Enigma machine (any variant will do), and students could test their results by attempting to decrypt real messages.  I'd have to do this myself, ahead of time, which would also be interesting for me.

Ideally, such a collection would contain enough material to build a statistical model of the plaintext, and for the students to try to find effective cribs.  It would also be nice to have at least a few messages of historical importance, and not just a long list of weather reports.

Does anyone know if such a collection exists?"

I just did the prompts.

 I looked at the right two passages and noticed they had the same pattern I then looked and saw it was a vigenere cipher. I asked chat gpt if it had the ability to work a vigenere cipher and it said it could and I had it do a frequency analysis.  They key it gave back after a frequency analysis was ""KRYPTOSISTHEKEY"".  I asked it to apply the key and I got back this response. ""BETWEENSUBTLESHADINGANDTHEABSENCEOFLIGHTLIESTHENUANCEOFIQLUCKIERSTILLISTHEHIDDENAGENDAOFTHECIPHERSINTERPENETRATINGSYMBOLS""

There is more information I do not know if this correct I just thought I would share this since it could be more information to the first passage. 

If you want to recreate this I prompted by  Vigenere cipher  and not saying its about Kryptos and had it treat it like a random cipher.  I first did identify and then frequency then asked to find the key off frequency then applied the key. 

""

I can certainly try! Based on the frequency analysis of the ciphertext, we can make educated guesses about the most likely letters used to encrypt each column. Here are the most likely letters for each column:

* Column 1: ""K""
* Column 2: ""R""
* Column 3: ""Y""
* Column 4: ""P""
* Column 5: ""O""
* Column 6: ""S""
* Column 7: ""T""
* Column 8: ""A""
* Column 9: ""I""
* Column 10: ""C""
* Column 11: ""H""
* Column 12: ""E""
* Column 13: ""R""
* Column 14: ""O""
* Column 15: ""S""
* Column 16: ""A""

Based on these guesses, we can construct a potential key as follows: ""KRYPTOSISTHEKEY"". This key has a repeating pattern of length 13, which corresponds to the length of the key used to encrypt the message.

I asked my professor about it and turns out, all we needed to do was make a 2x2 Matrix using those constants, mod 27 it and then round it off to get integers. I don't think the question was clear about this instruction.

The L in PLONK stands for Lagrange & I have seen videos & tweets by both Ariel Gabizon & Zac Williamson where they emphasise this particular aspect of PLONK - that it uses Lagrange Bases. 

I think PLONK's predecessor SONIC didn't use Lagrange Polynomials. However, SNARKs older than SONIC like Groth16 or Pinocchio do use Lagrange Interpolation to convert R1CS to QAP. In both Groth16 & Pinocchio, if your solution vector is of length `s` & your circuit has `g` gates, then you use Lagrange Interpolation to create `3s` polynomials each of degree `g-1` in the process of converting the R1CS to the QAP form.

So why so much fuss made about PLONK's use of Lagrange Bases? What am I missing? 
Another thing which makes me think I am missing something they emphasise the Lagrange ""base"" part rather than talking about the interpolation. But the Lagrange Base is just a part (the first step) of the Interpolation process."

For privacy reasons I want users to be able to create decoy accounts by registering a throwaway public key. I could instruct users to create a key pair normally, and then to discard the private key.

I'd like to create a helper system that would allow users to create decoy accounts in bulk. The user would need to trust this system not to keep private keys. If it's possible, I'd like to find a way to create a public key without actually creating private keys. I'd document that process, open source the code, and then run it on the helper system. In my use case, I expect some users to be able to trust that the helper system isn't running different code, generating private keys, and stealing them.

A naive approach would be to just create something that looks like a public key, but is actually just randomized. I'm concerned this would create a weak key, like an RSA key that can be factored really easily, or something that's easy to detect as a decoy because the structure is unusual.

The cryptographic library used is libsodium.

I use AEAD encryption for the confidentiality and integrity of the session message data (xchacha20-poly1305) and naturally public key cryptography for the session keys exchange at the start of the connection.

All keys are 256 bits (32 bytes), and all nonces are 192 bits (24 bytes). For the session nonces, I just increment the nonces as counters, and I know how much to increment because I use a sequence number for every message fragment (I dont' even send the nonce). I read from libsodium website that there is no pratical need to change session keys with xchacha20-poly1305, so I don't renegotiate session keys.

Naturally the problem is the actual exchange of session keys and nonces at the start of the connection. When a connection is accepted by the ""server"" (let's use the server-client for better describing a peer connecting and another accepting connections), I generate the symmetric session keys and nonces server side and send them to the ""client"" if the conneciton is accepted. I assume the client knows the server public key, and I use throw-away identities for encrypting the session keys in order to have some form of ""perfect forward-secrecy"" (the nonces are encrypted too even if not strictly necessary).

The protocol for initiating a connection is very minimalistic, and is composed of just 2 messages: a client request and a server response (or silence if the request was declined).

&#x200B;

Client side (connection request):

1. Generate client identity if necessary
2. Generate client throw-away (""ephemeral"") identity
3. Generate a message composed of plain data and encrypted payload: (client\_public\_key | random nonce | Encrypt\_server\_pk\_client\_sk( timestamp | ephemeral\_client\_public\_key | \[padded 0s to increase size to maximum payload size \] ))

The client\_public\_key is there because the server will need it to decrypt the payload, the nonce is randomly generated for every request. The timestamp is used for discarding old connection requests, and the padded zeros are there because it is a way to prevent the server to be exploited in some form DDOS attacks against other targets (I read it is good manner to make packet size request always > packet size response).

&#x200B;

Server side (connection response):

1. Decrypt client payload with client public key and server secret key to retrieve timestamp and ephemeral\_client\_public\_key.
2. Check timestamp to discard old requests.
3. Generate server ephemeral/throw-away identity.
4. Generate 2 random session symmetric keys and 2 random nonces (send and recv keys are different).
5. Use the client ephemeral identity and server ephemeral identity to encrypt the session keys and nonces.
6. Send the message to the client: (server\_public\_key | random\_nonce | ECRYPT\_client\_pk\_server\_sk( ephemeral\_server\_public\_key | encrypted\_session\_keys\_and\_nonces ))

&#x200B;

The client checks that the server public key match the stored one, and then try to decrypt the payload. If decryption is succesfull, it has all the information necessary to decrypt the session keys and nonces using the ephemeral identity of the server.

Is my protocol reasonable enough or I made some dangerous mistake I'm not aware of?

Suppose that I have a password p. From this, I want to derive new passwords. I calculate p1=hash(p-1), p2=hash(p-2), etc. This is trivial password salting with a counter and hashing (or a challenge response, like HMAC-SHA256(p, counter), where the challenge is a counter, perhaps a short random PIN that I can write down). Nothing fancy.

Since hash is one way, knowing p1, p2, … doesn’t tell anything about p. Also, if p is strong, say it’s a 256 bits key, brute forcing any of these passwords is not an option. Since p is 256 bits, I don’t care about slowing down key derivation using a fancy KDF such as Argon2 or PBKDF. If p is kept secure, p1, p2, … are secure.

Is there any problem with generating new passwords in this trivial manner? I just need to secure one password (for example, store it in HSM and do the hashing inside HSM)."

I have a performance and cost vs rotation frequency tradeoff that I'm trying to balance. I've been so far unable to find concrete information about risks of key reuse that would let me choose an evidence-based tolerance for how much key reuse is still cryptographically secure.

Let's say I have an arbitrary number of AES 256 GCM ciphertexts that were encrypted using the same key but a unique and random IV for each. Excluding side-channel attacks, is there a known attack that could take advantage of the repeated key use to help me get the plaintexts? How many repeated usages are needed before the attack becomes feasible?

Let's also say I obtained the corresponding plaintext for many of the ciphertexts via other means. Could having a multitude of ciphertext/plaintext pairs help me decrypt other plaintexts? Similarly to above, how many would be needed?

I'm aware there are other benefits to key rotation such as limiting blast radius if a key is exposed. In this case, I'm trying to more clearly understand whether there are also cryptographic reasons to limit key reuse."

In Real World Cryptography, Chapter 3.3.4, the author explains how MAC tag comparisons can be vulnerable to timing side-channel attacks. Essentially, the attacker guesses each possible value for the first byte of the tag, and when the verification routine takes the longest, this means the first byte is correct. 

Then, Chapter 7 has the following exercise (7.1):
> As you saw in chapter 3, authentication tags produced by MACs must be verified in constant time to avoid timing attacks. Do you think we need to do the same for verifying signatures?

The solution given at the end of the book is:
> No. is is because the verification of an authentication tag involves a secret key. Verifying a signature only involves a public key and, thus, does not need to be verified in constant time.

Does anyone else think this answer is a bit unclear, and maybe slightly misleading? When an attacker uses the timing side-channel attack, they're not attacking the secret key of the MAC scheme, but rather the MAC tag itself. In my opinion, the answer makes it sound like signatures are safe from these attacks because the public key is public. 

I feel like a better explanation would be that MAC schemes and signature schemes are fundamentally different in how the MAC tag/signature is verified. Because MACs are symmetric cryptography, verification involves recomputing the MAC tag and then comparing it with the provided MAC tag. Whereas signatures are asymmetric, so verification is a completely different operation which generally doesn't involve any comparison. Of course, this does indirectly link back to secret keys vs public/private keys.

Am I missing something here?"

There might be also some metadata, such as email address. 

But other than that, is there any risk with publishing public keys on internet? 

Put in another way, does a public key reveal any information that could help an attacker in any way? 

Perhaps those familiar with details of different types of asymmetric keys could comment on potential attacks on public keys."
2085,Is permutation-based crypto not catching on in the wild?,33,1208h1b,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/1208h1b/is_permutationbased_crypto_not_catching_on_in_the/,20,2023-03-24 09:33:16,"Permutation-based crypto is an approach to building symmetric-key cryptographic schemes defined by a pseudorandom permutation and a ""construction"" that uses the permutation, where the scheme is provably secure as long as the permutation satisfies certain properties. As far as I understand this makes it easier to trust the resulting schemes as safe because a single ""good"" permutation gives credibility to many potential schemes that use it. (Not a cryptographer.)

Permutation-based schemes seem to have taken over the cryptologic world by storm. Very quickly after the introduction of the Sponge construction around 2006/2007, many of the competing submissions for the SHA-3 cryptographic hash function contest were based on a sponge and a permutation, and indeed, Keccak (by the inventors of the sponge) won the competition. Some years afterwards, permutation-based submissions similarly dominated the CAESAR and the NIST Lightweight Cryptography (LWC) authenticated encryption competitions. In the meantime various variants on the sponge construction were introduced (duplex, donkeysponge, monkeyduplex).

Furthermore, it was apparent that permutation-based crypto offers a drastically simpler way to build an entire symmetric cryptography system with most of the implementation code reused compared to previous approaches. For example, to achieve authenticated encryption with the ChaCha20 stream cipher, one would usually pair it with the Poly1305 MAC. Permutation-based crypto, on the other hand, allows a single algorithm to be both a hash-function, extendable output function (XOF), MAC, and authenticated stream cipher. This makes permutation-based crypto look like the natural choice for implementing symmetric cryptography systems.

To paraphrase a paper by Daniel J. Bernstein et al (Gimli), a permutation being a better unified primitive than a block cipher seems to be a new conventional wisdom.

The sponge construction is inherently sequential, which was problematic for achieving competitive performance on modern computer architectures (because they enable parallel computation in multiple ways). This is why, ten years after the Sponge construction, the Keccak team published the Farfalle construction, a sort of parallel counterpart to the Sponge: https://keccak.team/farfalle.html

However, after all these (and other) developments in cryptology (perhaps even a revolution?), it seems that permutation-based crypto is still almost unused in ""the wild"", with no sign of this changing. Am I right about this?

I guess that the Keccak permutation may be too-slow to be competitive in all cases, and the other ones aren't yet vetted enough to be considered safe? Is it merely a matter of time until the permutation-based crypto revolution translates into the world of programming and network protocols?

Am I missing something?"

I've been wondering how hard it would be for an untrained person to steal internal company documents by hiding their contents inside a video file, uploading that file to youtube, and then allowing some 3rd party to download it with a youtube video downloader.

Can be done in an obvious way, just has to be viewable as video. Doesn't have to be anything crazy, like making the video look normal, it's fine if the video looks like a mess.

I tried to do it myself by tinkering with renaming, writing and converting mp4, txt and gif files. I failed.

The reason why I'm interested, is because tinkering with files that you already have on your PC, as well as uploading the video to youtube is undetectable by IDS systems (they are like antivirus programs, but for network traffic for the whole company). The only thing an IDS would notice is that a lot of data was uploaded to youtube, but it wouldn't be able to tell what it was, because the communication is encrypted. There also wouldn't be any way to know which account the person used to do it.

If you're worrying about what I'm going to do with this information, I work in cybersecurity and I'm just interested."

The ciphertexts will be manually copied around by the user, so I want them to be as short as possible, especially since encoding them to ASCII adds another 25% of overhead. Also, malleability doesn't seem like a concern. What are my options?
  
If I used a stream cipher, I'd have to use a fairly big nonce to prevent the catastrophic consequences of nonce reuse. I'm instead considering using CBC with ciphertext stealing, since I think the worst consequence of IV reuse here would be that an attacker could tell if two passwords start with the same string - which doesn't seem concerning for randomly generated passwords. I could thus probably get away with a very small (1-byte), or possibly even no IV. Am I correct in this thinking?"

I'm pleased to announce that OpenFHE has been accepted to GSoC 2023 under the NumFOCUS umbrella (see [2023 project listing](https://github.com/numfocus/gsoc/blob/master/2023/ideas-list.md)). Our proposed projects are listed on our [wiki](https://github.com/openfheorg/openfhe-development/wiki/GSOC-2023) but TL;DR we're hoping to expand the library's reach by providing SDKs for  

- iOS
- Android

and we're hoping to create a backend for [HEBench](https://github.com/hebench), which is an open-source framework for profiling various FHE libraries.

You don't *need* to have a background in FHE, but it might be helpful. We're mostly looking for strong programmers who are interested in learning more about FHE and getting their hands dirty.

# About OpenFHE

**What is FHE**: Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) is a powerful cryptographic primitive that enables performing computations over encrypted data without having access to the secret key.

**What is OpenFHE**: From [our github page](https://github.com/openfheorg/openfhe-development): OpenFHE is an open-source FHE library that includes efficient implementations of all common FHE schemes:

- Brakerski/Fan-Vercauteren (BFV) scheme for integer arithmetic
- Brakerski-Gentry-Vaikuntanathan (BGV) scheme for integer arithmetic
- Cheon-Kim-Kim-Song (CKKS) scheme for real-number arithmetic (includes approximate bootstrapping)
- Ducas-Micciancio (DM) and Chillotti-Gama-Georgieva-Izabachene (CGGI) schemes for evaluating Boolean circuits and arbitrary functions over larger plaintext spaces using lookup tables

As a way to learn, I chose to do a simple CLI tool to encrypt data (like a file) to a PURB using a public key (think something like Age, but producing PURBs and with less functionality). This tool is obviously not for production use (unless someone volunteers to audit it, lol).

While I understand how it can work for symmetric crypto, I am looking to ultimately add public key cryptography to the tool. In this case, for PURBs to remain PURBs, I will need to use some procedure to make the key material look like uniform randomness as well.

I've taken a look at obfs4, because they do something similar to what I want, and they are using [Elligator 2](https://github.com/Yawning/obfs4/blob/master/doc/obfs4-spec.txt#L154) to make their key exchange look like random data. I've also heard of it being used elsewhere for similar purposes. I've then tried to look for libraries that implement this functionality. I am primarily focused on Golang, so that's where I started to look. For example, I found this library: [https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/bwesterb/go-ristretto#Point.SetElligator](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/bwesterb/go-ristretto#Point.SetElligator), but I was unable to understand their documentation, because I do not know some of the terms they use. I also tried to look for Lizard encoding and found nothing.

Another library that I took a look at is Monocypher: [https://monocypher.org/manual/elligator](https://monocypher.org/manual/elligator). Their documentation is much easier to read, but I am still confused, because they use yet another set of terminology compared to the Go library.

This is not in any way an attempt to say that these libraries are bad, they are certainly oriented at people who know what they are doing while I certainly don't, but I would love to learn about this stuff. Can you please give me some pointers where I can learn what all the terminology means, and how the different parts of these systems interact together?

Thank you!"

2106,"Monocypher 4.0.0 is out: full Argon2 support, safer signature API, and more",42,11ds4im,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/11ds4im/monocypher_400_is_out_full_argon2_support_safer/,0,2023-02-28 06:15:09,"[Download](https://monocypher.org/download/), subscribe, bell, money — wait…

I know this may not be appropriate, but this particular release is kind of important. The main reason for this release is because, like many other libraries out there, its EdDSA signatures API was [prone to catastrophic misuse](https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/vfl2se/initial_impact_report_about_this_weeks_eddsa/). And now it's fixed.

_<rant> I will quickly note that this class of vulnerabilities could have been avoided if the original authors of NaCl had prominently explained why they put the private & public halves together in the same private key. The fact that not doing so could be just as catastrophic as a nonce reuse should have been noted in the original Ed25519 paper. Instead many of us found ourselves thinking the NaCl API was kind of ugly, and went on separating the private & public halves because it looks cleaner, or is more flexible. </rant>_

There are lots of little changes, and a few big ones:

- Full Argon2 support. Argon2i, Argon2d, Argon2id, multiple lanes. (Multiple lanes are for compatibility only, they don't actually use multi-threading). And the code got simpler to boot. I will likely ask the IETF/CFRG to add it to the RFC.
- Safer EdDSA API. Now private keys are 64 bytes, and include their own public half. Manual says don't split those halves, or else.
- EdDSA now behaves exactly like the Zebra library.
- Replaced the incremental and custom hash EdDSA API by a proper set of low-level functions.

The last two deserve a bit more explanation.

---

First the Zebra compatibility. Monocypher now uses the batch verification equation (that ignores the low-order components of the points it checks), non-canonical encodings are permitted, and low-order points are permitted. Of course, Non-canonical S encoding are still forbidden, we don't want malleability. My reasons for this choice are best explained in [Henry de Valence's post on the subject](https://hdevalence.ca/blog/2020-10-04-its-25519am).

The choice of accepting low-level points can seem surprising, given that other libraries, most notably libsodium and parts of Dalek, chose on the contrary to forbid them. I initially thought of following the RFC, but I ran into a couple problems:

- The RFC gives you a choice between the batch equation *or* the strict equation.
- The RFC forbids non-canonical encodings, which are a pain to check for. Well, at least they only affect low-order points…
- …which are _allowed_ by the RFC.

Now I understand why almost no one conforms to the RFC. So I've chosen to be maximally permissive instead. That way I'm sure to accept any signature that is considered valid by another library (except TweetNaCl, which does not check for malleability), in particular those who perform batch verification, whose speed up can't be ignored. Also, accepting low-order points & non-canonical encodings is just simpler. Sure we could ban them, but this wouldn't increase security one bit: recipients need to validate the public keys they receive anyway, otherwise attackers could just provide their own key.

---

Second, the low-level API. This whole endeavour started from someone asking me to implement Ed25519ph for them. I initially warned them that I was relatively expensive, and tried to steer them to cheaper alternatives. They paid up. And so I worked. And that work gave me a deeper understanding of some low-level aspects of EdDSA, and the idea for a new low-level API emerged. Without this job you probably wouldn't see this new API today.

So. I used to love my incremental and custom hash API but it was complicated, somewhat error prone, and quite rigid. So I took the opportunity of the major release to replace it by this simpler and more flexible idea I had:

* One function to trim scalars (clearing 4 bits and setting one).
* One function to reduce 64-byte numbers modulo L (the order of the prime order subgroup of the curve).
* A mul-add function (modulo L).
* A fixed based scalar multiplication (with a trimmed or untrimmed scalar).
* A ""check equation"" function.

Turned out that from those, it's pretty easy to implement various EdDSA variants, including something like an incremental API, an API that uses a hedged nonce (composed of a hash of the message *and* a random component), or an API closer to ECDSA for users who don't want to hash the message twice (not implemented nor encouraged in the manual for obvious reasons), or variants of EdDSA, such as Ed25519ph (implemented as an option), or XEdDSA (exemplified in the manual). And of course the custom hash ability, which I needed to implement EdDSA-Blake2b and Ed25519.

Note the odd one out, `crypto_check_equation()`. It's pretty high level, but it turned out to be enough. The main advantage there is that users have only *one* verification to make. Once they've hashed the relevant input they just give it the public key, hash, and signature, and it takes care of everything, including key validation. I'm very glad to see this ""low-level"" verification API being mostly foot-gun free.

Another advantage is the flexibility in the implementation: I'm not bound to the double scalar multiplication, and can explore various trade-offs. Which I will_ eventually, there are plans for an ""embedded"" edition of Monocypher, tailored for smaller chips such as the Cortex M0."

One idea I'm experimenting with is peppering data by encrypting them with secret keys stored only in ENV variables.

I can easily do that with data that I don't search. Since I don't search them, I can generate a random nonce for each encryption.

My problem is doing that with e-mails, since I need them to be searchable. So I need the encrypted e-mails to be deterministic and secure.

Right now my approach is to reuse the nonce to keep the encrypted e-mails searchable. I'm using Libsodium's XChaCha20-Poly1305 to encrypt.

Is it possible to encrypt e-mails securely while keeping them searchable in the database? What library can I use to do this in JS?

&#x200B;

We are fully aware that using hardware-encryption on a Windows operating-system drive (""C:"" drive) is much more complicated and requires setting up a PBA, etc.

&#x200B;

So, all of the questions are assuming that the main operating-system drive (Windows ""C:"" drive) is not hardware-encrypted, and only the other non-operating-system SSD drives (""D:"", ""E:"" and ""F:"") are hardware-encrypted using ""sedutil-cli.exe"".

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

(1)

When using ""sedutil"" hardware-encrypted non-operating-system drives on Windows (not Linux), is Sleep (S3) supported?  In other words, can a computer with ""sedutil-cli.exe"" unlocked non-operating-system drive(s) be put to ""Sleep"", wake from sleep and no problems with using those hardware-encrypted non-operating-system drive(s) as such?

&#x200B;

The main ""sedutil"" github page says that Sleep (S3) is not supported, but it is unclear to us whether they are referring only to Linux or to both Linux and Windows:

&#x200B;

[https://github.com/Drive-Trust-Alliance/sedutil](https://github.com/Drive-Trust-Alliance/sedutil)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

(2)

If the answer to (1) is ""NO"", then does this mean that only Windows hibernation is supported when using ""sedutil"" hardware-encrypted non-operating-system drives?  Or is Windows hibernation not supported either?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

(3)

If Windows hibernation is supported using ""sedutil-cli"" hardware-encrypted non-operating-system drives, then consider the following simple use case:

&#x200B;

Suppose we used ""sedutil-cli.exe"" to unlock sedutil-hardware-encrypted non-operating-system drives ""D:"", ""E:"" and ""F:"" - and those hardware-encrypted non-operating-system drives are in use by applications and/or are even running applications.

&#x200B;

Then, we put the machine to ""Hibernate"" - the machine is now in a fully powered-off state.

&#x200B;

We turn the machine back on - the machine loads the contents of RAM from the hibernation image file (""C:\\hiberfil.sys""), and resumes the operating-system and all running applications - supposedly to the same state as the computer had been, right at being set to hibernate.

&#x200B;

Are drives ""D:"" ""E:"" and ""F:"" still unlocked, functioning and usable without crashing any applications and without any other issues?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The only information we have on using ""sedutil"" on non-root (non-operating-system) drives are from the following wiki, but most of the sedutil docs are linux-only and do not really explain how to make hardware-encryption work with sleep/hibernate/etc. on Windows: 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Self-encrypting\_drives#Encrypting\_a\_non-root\_drive](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Self-encrypting_drives#Encrypting_a_non-root_drive)  (slightly helpful but outdated)

&#x200B;

[https://github.com/Drive-Trust-Alliance/sedutil/wiki/Encrypting-your-drive](https://github.com/Drive-Trust-Alliance/sedutil/wiki/Encrypting-your-drive) (not very helpful to us because it only explains the more-complicated setup of PBA for operating-system drives.)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

(4)

Upon reading the manual, ""sedutil-cli.exe"" provides a very non-intuitive user-interface with complicated command-line-arguments that are very difficult (at least for us) to understand:

&#x200B;

[https://github.com/Drive-Trust-Alliance/sedutil/wiki/Command-Syntax](https://github.com/Drive-Trust-Alliance/sedutil/wiki/Command-Syntax)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

It is definitely not as simple as using the BitLocker CLI which is as simple as:

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

For hardware-encrypting drive F: with password-protector - should be instantaneous since hardware-encryption, unlike software-encryption, is instantaneous:

&#x200B;

manage-bde.exe -on F: -ForceEncryptionType hardware -Password

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

For locking drive F:

&#x200B;

manage-bde.exe -lock F:

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

For unlocking drive F:

&#x200B;

manage-bde.exe -unlock F:

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

For checking status of all drives:

&#x200B;

manage-bde.exe -status

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

If someone could provide the equivalent commands for using ""sedutil-cli.exe"" to do all of the tasks above, that would also be greatly appreciated."

I want to get expert's opinions on implementing security and brute-force resistance to PBKDF2. The project is a desktop database (no cloud - local storage) application that CRUDs proprietary sensitive data. 

First, my threat model warrants that offline attacks are the most concern. Should someone steal the database, I want resistance. I am less concerned about online attacks.

I chose an on-the-fly design. Data is encrypted/decrypted as it is read/written to the database. With that said, I am responsible for securing the backend. Not the DB system. So here are some questions, give the context.

Note:  Assume all encryption is AES-256 CBC mode. I wasn't concerned with offline attacks until I read about modern gaming GPU stacks cracking tons of passwords in a single day. 

1.).  PBKDF2 - Does simply using PBKDF2 to lengthen a key prior to AES256 provide enough entropy to be practically impossible to crack? I know the rounds are used to make computationally expensive. The problem is, I must keep rounds 500 - 1000 to meet performance requirements. 

2.) What relationship exists between rounds of PBKDF2 and brute forcing raw cipher text? People say that lengthening your user password to a KDF is far more efficient than increasing rounds. OK. So why don't I just hash the password or lengthen it somehow before inputing into the KDF? Because all that did was simulate a single KDF 'Round/interation' ?

3.) Is it acceptable to use PBKDF2 or another KDF as a hash function for authentication? Just curious. I've seen mixed discussion on this.

This will force hackers to compromise both endpoints in order to compromise the file rather than having to compromise just a singular point. Finally, since RE-VFS is built over The Citadel Protocol, all perks of using the protocol, such as multi-layered cryptography and multi-layered ratcheting, are available to greatly increase the security of the files.

What goes on under the hood with The Citadel Protocol's efficient use of Kyber-based data encryption?

2137,Why is the Key in Blake2's keyed mode kept in a separate block?,25,10nuocy,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/10nuocy/why_is_the_key_in_blake2s_keyed_mode_kept_in_a/,9,2023-01-29 06:23:17,"As far as I know, Blake2 (I'm thinking of Blake2b specifically) has a keyed mode that is intended to be used as a key derivation function: put the input key material in the key, and if there's enough entropy the whole thing is a Random Oracle, and the output can be used as an encryption key.

Now when it comes to actually adding the key to the input, Blake2 doesn't do the obvious:

    Blake2b(key || other_stuff)

And we don't even need to insert the key size in there to ensure proper separation between `key` and `other_stuff`, since the key size is already encoded in the parameter block.

Instead, it reserves an _entire block_ for the key:

    block = key || zeroes -- 128 bytes total
    Blake2b(block || other_stuff)

Which is kind of a pity, because if the total length of the `key` and `other_stuff` doesn't exceed a single block, we end up hashing 2 blocks regardless, while the obvious approach would have let us hash only 1.

I do understand that it does help with some optimisations: loading data byte by byte on my laptop almost halved overall speed, so having the `other_stuff` start at a block boundary does make things a bit easier on that front. But to be honest I'm not sure that's the only reason. I'm afraid in particular that there's a security consideration. Personally I can think of two:

- Making sure the key goes through the compression function before we process the other input (that is more likely to be attacker controlled) may mitigate some side channel attacks (faults, energy).
- Maybe compressing the key alone helps with mathematical security as well? Maybe that's what it take for us to be sure that Blake2 is indistinguishable from a Random Oracle?

Even more confusing, the size of the key isn't limited to 128 bytes. It's limited to only 64. (Same for Blake2s where blocks are 64 bytes, keys are limited to 32 bytes.) Of the top of my head I can see only one reason: minimising attacker controlled inputs. Salsa20 and ChaCha20 do this: 16 bytes for a constant, 32 bytes for a key, and the remaining 16 bytes may be attacker controlled (and even so, 8 of them are likely not, because it's the counter). Thing is, the only thing we give Blake2 here is the _key_, so making sure at least half of the block isn't attacker controlled makes little sense: _nothing_ is attacker controlled, it's supposed to be a key, right?

_Whyyy?_

---

_(This is not just an academic question: I would like to know if I can safely use `Blake2b(key_size || key || other_stuff)` as a KDF, or if I need to stick to the official API.)_

---

Update: I've got an answer to why the key is separated to its own block. From the [HKDF paper](https://eprint.iacr.org/2010/264.pdf), page 22, we can read:

> For random SKM, HKDF becomes an application of HMAC which is the standard and widely accepted PRF mode for Merkle-Damgard hash functions. The traditional scheme, in contrast, builds the PRF using the hash function in “key-prepended mode”, a mode that has long been deprecated in favor of schemes such as HMAC. In particular, key-prepended schemes need to care about extension attacks thus requiring careful prefix-free encoding of the input. Moreover, such a scheme does not even follow the usual practice of aligning (via padding) the prepended key to a block boundary (as to induce a random IV).

So:

* HMAC is rad because it turns random compression functions into random oracles. That's why it's so often the way to go, especially with the SHA-2 family of hashes, which because of length extension attacks cannot be modeled as random oracles. Now to be checked, but I'm pretty sure modern hashes like BLAKE2 and SHA-3 also turn their internal (assumed random) compression function into a random oracle. Thus, no need for HMAC on these, its capabilities are built in.

* The reason the key needs to live in its own block, is to give BLAKE2 a random IV instead of a predictable one. My guess here is that starting to compress the input only _after_ we get that random IV makes security reductions easier… or _possible_.

As for why the key size cannot exceed half the block size, I think we can deduce it by looking at BLAKE2b itself: see, when the compression function has processed 128 bytes worth of input, it only retains a 64-bit hash. The whole scheme cannot _possibly_ accumulate more than 64 bytes of entropy, so we might as well make it a hard limit, so users _know_ keys can't get any stronger."

For instance when generating a 4096 bit key first choose a prime somewhere around 2^2048 like normally, then compute 2^4096 divided by the chosen prime and find a prime just below that number. Using these two primes the modulo will be on the form `2^4096 - n` where `n` is a number slightly larger than 2048 bits.

As best I can tell this will speed up public operations by making the modulo operation approximately twice as fast. For private operations using the Chinese Remainder trick this modulo is used less, thus making the gain relatively smaller.

I don't believe there is any known factoring method that could take serious advantage of this form.

I guess I'm not the first person to notice this, and with RSA generally being replaced I guess this won't ever see much use, but I found it curious."

2145,Can someone help me do this POC length extension attack?,18,10iougv,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/10iougv/can_someone_help_me_do_this_poc_length_extension/,5,2023-01-22 22:52:25,"Hi, I've been trying to read up on length extension attacks, and wanted to try to do a proof of concept attack.

So, I found [this](https://github.com/stephenbradshaw/hlextend) small repo, which should be able to do length extension attacks for me. They have an example for sha1, so I thought I would just do my example with that as well

Lets say that we observe a message a known message which is ""message"" , which has been hashed with the secret key ""secret1234"", which we know is 10 digits long.

So the integrity code would be made with hash(""secret1234""|""message"")

and Then we want to create our own valid hash, where we have appended the word ""file"".

Some very basic proof of concept code would be:

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

    import hlextend
    import hashlib
    
    
    def hash(message, secret):
        payload = secret + message
        hash_object = hashlib.sha1(bytes(payload,""utf-8""))
        return hash_object.hexdigest()
    
    
    message = ""hello""
    secret = ""secret1234""
    
    ### First, we create our own hash
    print(hash(message, secret)) 
    
    
    
    ## We then try to make a forged hash, using length extension, where we try to append the word ""file""
    sha = hlextend.new('sha1')
    forged = sha.extend(""file"", message, 10,'52e98441017043eee154a6d1af98c5e0efab055c')
    print(forged)
    print(sha.hexdigest())
    
    
    ## and now we check if our forged signature makes is correct:
    
    print(hash(forged,secret))

The extend() function outputs the string that I should be able to use, with padding, in order to create the forged tag

And if I run this code. I will get this  output:

    52e98441017043eee154a6d1af98c5e0efab055c
    hello\x80\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00xfile
    c60fa7de0860d4048a3bfb36b70299a95e6587c9
    876d8406a52c71321930e99ac44740ccaea3d080

If I made the attack correctly, the last two hashes should be the same. But they are not.

&#x200B;

For that reason, I don't know if I have misunderstood something about the length extension attack.

Can someone point out to me what I might be misunderstanding, or doing wrong?"

I've been looking at trying to understand how Signal encrypts attachments and i'm seeing something I don't understand. It uses a pretty standard algorithm (AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding) but each file appears to contain lots of junk. 

Taking a small 7 byte text file as an example (containing the string ""test123""), it gets encrypted to a file that's 576 bytes. It starts with an IV, then a cipher text of the plaintext, doubled (so in this case, test123test123). There is also a 32 byte mac but I have no idea what all the other data is. When it's decrypted, it looks like Signal just ignores most of the file. It basically just keeps decrypting the file until it has at least as many bytes as the original file, then discards anything over that.

I'm not a crypto expect but do a lot of mobile app reversing and this isn't something i've seen before. I've tried to find an analysis of it, but didn't find much that was publicly available.

I'm currently working on a realtime collaborative end-to-end encrypted note-taking app and I'm wondering how to best handle encryption key rotation. I want to provide the best data safety I can for my users, but also need to implement this for compliance.

In my app each page has a different encryption key for encrypting data. I'm using the Sodium library, so the encryption algorithm is XSalsa20-Poly1305. Pages are contained in groups. Groups represent both page groups and user groups. Each group has an encryption key that encrypts all encryption keys of the contained pages. This group encryption key is asymmetrically distributed to the group users using X25519-XSalsa20-Poly1305. I need to periodically rotate all the keys of a group.

The main problems I'm facing are that groups can become quite big and it's hard to rotate keys while the car is moving without disrupting user interaction or possibly corrupting the data by badly handling key rotation.

I don't think envelope encryption helps in this case because I'm almost sure enveloping doesn't add any security benefits in end-to-end encryption (please correct me if I'm wrong), so it looks like I'm forced to reencrypt all data on key rotation, not just a key.

One detail is that for realtime collaboration I'm using Yjs, which works by transmitting small updates on each user input. In my case each of these updates is encrypted with the page encryption key. Every 500 updates or so I send the whole state of the page to the server in order to merge all the small stored updates, and also for purposes of backup.

So one idea I came up with is to progressively encrypt page data by doing a ""key rollover"" where I generate a new key for all future encryptions, but keep the old key(s) for decryption of old data. This would allow a seamless transition to the new key. However, this would probably require some mechanism to identify and discard old keys, which I'm still unsure how to develop.

So now I have these questions in mind:

* What are other options for key rotation? Is there a simpler way to do this?
* Is envelope encryption really out of question?
* Would I really need to discard old keys in this ""key rollover"" thing? Because if I didn't then my problem is solved right now.

I would really appreciate any insights or advice on this topic. Thanks in advance!"

[Rustdocs](https://avarok-cybersecurity.github.io/Citadel-Protocol/docs/)

[Whitepaper](https://github.com/Avarok-Cybersecurity/Citadel-Protocol/blob/master/The_Citadel_Protocol.pdf)

The Citadel Protocol is a high-performance asynchronous signal-like protocol written in rust that extends upon the ratcheting algorithm by using multi-layered ratcheting, multi-layered encryption, post-quantum key exchange, configurable **true** perfect forward secrecy (each packet gets a unique encryption key via re-keying) or best-effort modes, file-transfer encryption, built-in NAT traversal (no libp2p), configurable credentialed authentication (via argon-2id), device-dependent authentication, or passwordless authentication, amongst other features.

The Citadel Protocol is built on top of an underlying transport protocol. Either TCP, TLS, or QUIC may be used for transport (Default TLS for hybrid cryptography). The Citadel Protocol is used to communicate between nodes in the network.

The network topology contains a central globally-reachable node that is, by default, used for peer discovery and NAT traversal (this node can have application logic endowed unto it, but is not required).  Peers connect to this central server, and, upon registration and connection, are able to then message pass amongst each other and even the central server.

Since NAT traversal is easier to perform with UDP, the QUIC protocol is used for P2P connections as this is complimentary. For Client to server connections, the server can choose to use TCP, TLS, or QUIC as an underlying protocol.

1. I'm looking for a small, portable, fast, constant-time, and generally verified to be safe implementation of Classic McEliece. Obviously, there's the reference implementation in the NIST submission, but that depends on OpenSSL and SUPERCOP. I don't want to bring in both of those huge libraries in addition to libsodium just for playing around and creating a toy program. I know a lot of this post-quantum stuff is still too early to be incorporated into mainstream crypto libraries like libsodium or OpenSSL. But I want to play around with it and make a toy mceliece8192128-AES-GCM file encryption program just to get familiar with it.


2. God those key sizes are huge. Any thoughts on generating a very seldom used McEliece keypair deterministically over and over again from a 256 bit seed to save space? I know you can safely do it with ECDH and RSA  as long as the seed is cryptographically random, and is never leaked.

I also understand we don't want to work in a small subgroup like 1,2,4,8 as it has security implications, but, as far as I can see, the probability of generating a key which yields one of these 15 points seems infinitesimally small, is the concern only around ECDH (where you cannot control your partners key selection) and not signatures?"

2174,Need help with applying differential cryptanalysis,17,100g7af,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/100g7af/need_help_with_applying_differential_cryptanalysis/,0,2023-01-01 15:02:43,"Hi,

I've recently been looking into differential cryptanalysis, by reading this paper [here](https://www.engr.mun.ca/~howard/PAPERS/ldc_tutorial.pdf). I've also previously asked on this subreddit about the details of differential cryptanalysis. I decided to go further and get some hands-on experience with differential cryptanalysis, by attempting to break a cipher using it.

I've written my own block cipher with a block size of 64 bits. It's a substitution-permutation network with 5 rounds. Inside this SP-network, I use an S-box that are 8 bits wide (i.e. map 8 bit inputs to 8 bit outputs), and a P-box which shuffle the order of bits. I use a key that is 320 bits long, so that I have a 64 bit subkey for each round (64 * 5 = 320).

On every round, I XOR the text with the round key, pass it through the S-box, and then pass that through the P-box. I repeat this for 5 rounds, and whatever comes out at the end is my ciphertext.

After writing the code for constructing such a scheme, I randomly generated a configuration for my P-box and my S-box, and constructed my block cipher. While I have read the differential cryptanalysis part of the tutorial linked above, I am not sure how I am supposed to execute this in practice.

I know that I should start by analyzing my S-box and look for characteristics with high probabilities for one individual S-box, but I am not sure how I translate this to finding a differential characteristic for the entire cipher. The tutorial never states an algorithm for such. It seems that the best I can do is brute-force every possible differential characteristic, which will probably take an extremely long amount of time, perhaps even longer than brute-forcing the key itself.

For reference, [here's](https://pastebin.com/YnF3t32e) the source code for my cipher. I don't believe my cipher is secure, but I'm not sure how to break it either, following the differential cryptanalysis tutorial linked above. Could anyone explain to me/guide me through the process of differentially cryptanalysing & breaking such a cipher? Or should I start with other methods of cryptanalysis?"

I'm just looking to get a second opinion on the example AES-CTR code on MDN docs:

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SubtleCrypto/encrypt#aes-ctr_2

There's actually two examples there. One where the ""length"" field is 64, and one where is 128. If you follow the links to the ""complete"" Github example, I can only find the first one (which I believe to be correct).

It's baffling that the API exposes this, which is described above as ""the number of bits in the counter block that are used for the actual counter"". I'm not aware of any other API that makes a developer specify this. Surely if there's a standard answer the API should just default to it. But I digress..

In the example given where the length is 128, the entire IV is used as an actual counter. Surely there's a reason we have this whole concept of ""some bytes are the counter"". I've written a PR because it feels like this is a problem to fix, but I'd hate to put forward a crypto bug and get told there's nothing wrong."

**Example:** Assume 10 participants where each chooses a value for a set e.g. {0,1} and we want to generate the **sum** of the 10 values without disclosing each participant's choice.

Using an additive MPC scheme (e.g. Shamir Secret Sharing) each participant can generate 10 shares and encrypt **each of them using the unique public key of each participant**. This will generate 10 (9 and its own) **encrypted** shares. Now each participant receives 10 shares **encrypted with their own public key** and decrypts them using their own private key. They add the shares and then broadcast the sum. Using the 10 broadcasted sums we can now reconstruct the **sum** of all 10 **choices**, which should be 0 <= s <= 10.

In order for the protocol to be safe however, we need the following: *Each participant must generate a NIZK proof/argument that shows that their distributed MPC* ***shares*** *would resolve to {0,1} if we reconstructed the secret value.* Note that the participants never want reveal their shares to everyone nor the secret reconstructed value!

EDIT: This is **not** my homework! I'm not looking for someone to solve this for me! Although a solution would be cool, giving me pointers on what to study is equally good/better.

I've been reading [this](http://www.cs.bc.edu/~straubin/crypto2017/heys.pdf) paper on it, and I have a rough understanding of how it works.

The general concept is to analyze the probability of each output's ""differential"" given an input ""differential"", and pick an input diff-output diff pair with a high probability value (what is called a ""differential characteristic"").

Then, to try get bits from the last round key, do the following:

1. Find a differential characteristic for (n-1) rounds of the cipher
2. Generate a bunch of known plaintext-ciphertext pairs for testing purposes, that differ by the input differential of that known differential characteristic.
3. Test each ""hypothesis"" for a possible value of the last round key. For each round key candidate, for each pair of ciphertexts, XOR each ciphertext with the round key and pass it backwards through the S-box to see what the input to the last S-box would have been for each in the pair. Keep a ""score"" for each round key candidate, and increment it every time the hypothetical input to the last S-box matches what is predicted by the differential characteristic.
4. The round key candidate that has the highest score, i.e. has the most ciphertext pairs whose corresponding ""input to the last S-box"" values differ by the differential characteristic, is our most likely round key.

We can repeat this for previous rounds, working backwards one at a time until we deduce all the correct round keys (and thus break the cipher in the chosen-plaintext attack).

This is what I understand of differential cryptanalysis, and how it can be applied in key recovery. What I don't understand, however, is why the 4th step is necessarily true. If the round key is not the correct one, is there any guarantee that its score will necessarily be low?

The paper says ""an incorrect subkey is assumed to result in a relatively random guess at the bits entering the S-boxes of the last round"", but is there any mathematical proof/intuition as to why this is the case? I would assume that there is more rigor to this than ""well I guess a wrong subkey will lead to a relatively random distribution of guesses at the bits entering the S-boxes of the last round, maybe."""

## Disclaimer

PGP is very outdated as a cryptosystem and I probably shouldn't be encouraging its use in the modern day. Yet, the fact remains that PGP has withstood the test of time as a powerful general purpose cryptography toolchain.

Today PGP remains the standard for git commit signing, release-hash signing, end-to-end-encrypted email, hardware-backed SSH access, and many other common use cases for decentralized cryptography. It will probably still be around a long time yet, and until it goes away naturally, key backups will always be important."

Maybe my concerns are unwarranted, and I'm going to admit that I am not an expert on storage encryption. Storage encryption, and the unique challenges it has compared to online protocols is a bit of a gap in my knowledge.

My knowledge on the topic is pretty much limited to:

1) You don't want an attacker who is actively monitoring the ciphertext being written to the disk to get any clues about the plaintext other than the amount of plaintext you're writing.

2) The ciphertext must be the same length as the plaintext - so using a proper MAC to authenticate each sector is not practical.

3) In the absence of a proper MAC, naively modifying the ciphertext on the disk should at least garble the plaintext.

Beyond this, I really don't know much about storage encryption. My understanding is that AES-XTS has pretty much been the go-to solution that checks most of the boxes for a very long time now. It's seen a lot of public review, and there is high confidence that it accomplishes what it says it does.

It's still kind of new, but I haven't seen much outside review on Adiantum. That concerns me - unless the security really is just that obvious to everybody except me. It just kind of got hurried into the Linux kernel and made part of the Android standard. Honestly, I'm leaning towards just using AES-XTS on an upcoming embedded Linux project and just taking the performance hit.

2195,Proof of Concept: Anonymize Messages using the Double Ratchet Algorithm,36,zl9inc,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/zl9inc/proof_of_concept_anonymize_messages_using_the/,8,2022-12-14 04:14:55,"This was a hobby project inspired by the frequent complaints about Signal requiring phone numbers that crop up on forums like Hacker News. How can you have practical anonymous (not pseudonymous!) private messaging at scale? Most approaches in the literature use Mix or DC nets, which can present issues when scaling up to very large populations of users (for instance, the keychains required for DC grow very large with the number of users, and sender+receiver anonymous Mix Nets require a lot of very complex system architecture to work properly).

This is a [proof of concept (a writeup, a Verifpal script, and a bare-bones Rust implementation)](https://github.com/BurntChromium/lethe/blob/master/protocol-writeup.md) of a protocol where each new message between a pair of users is sent to a different (seemingly) random address. Essentially, if Alice and Bob are communicating, Alice deposits a message on a server addressed to ""Mailbox 10347"" and Bob can read it, and reply with a message to ""Mailbox 47323"", which is followed up with a reply by Alice to ""Mailbox 17374"" and so on.

The trick to coordinating these addresses is to use the Double Ratchet algorithm to allow Alice and Bob to be aware of which address the other is about to use, but to prevent anyone outside this conversation from linking the sequence of used addresses.

A more technical writeup is available here, along with the code and verification script: [link](https://github.com/BurntChromium/lethe/blob/master/protocol-writeup.md).

To re-emphasize, this is only a hobby project: it is for curiosity and educational purposes only, has not been peer reviewed, is not safe for use, and so on."

I'm at the point where I'm explaining how point addition on an elliptic curve works, and how we can calculate x * P where P is some point on the curve and x is some random 256 bit integer in no more than 510 point additions (by pre-computing the series 2^0 * P, 2^1 * P, 2^2 * P, 2^3 * P, ..., 2^255 * P (takes 255 point additions) and then by doing binary expansion on x (takes at most 255 point additions since the binary expansion of x can contain at most 256 elements) and then combining them.

I go on to say that although it is trivial (taking only 510 at most point addition steps) to calculate some value X, where X = x * P, reversing that operation, that is, calculating x when you know P and X is thought to be hard. I wanted to ask if this is actually still true on a non-discrete elliptic curve. I was planning on holding off on explaining the whole, ""well, actually we want to change y^2 = x^3 + ax + b thing into y^2 mod p = (x^3 + ax + b) mod p"" until a later presentation, but I wanted to ask some more knowledgeable cryptographers if calculating x from X and P on a non-discrete elliptic curve is actually hard. Also, is it as hard as the discrete version? If the answer is that it's not as hard, any explanation you may have to offer which might help my own understanding would be much appreciated.

The reason I wanted to essentially mention only in passing the whole ""well, it's actually discrete thing"" is because I was hoping that the principles would still be just as useful in garnering an intuitive understanding of the topic without making the underlying math get just that much trickier by having to mod everything. 

Thanks for the help!

edit: I think after doing a bit more research and thinking about it, I may be able to answer my own question, though I still invite the inputs of others. 

For exponentiation over the reals we can use calculus and do a handful of tricks like maybe coming up with some Taylor series whose partial sum will be pretty close to the answer we want. When we instead switch to discrete points in a finite field, calculus no longer applies.

For a more intuitive answer, I think this fact can illustrate why the discrete logarithm problem is likely harder than the logarithm problem. If a and b are close, n^a and n^b are close as well for the non-discrete problem. For the discrete problem however, there does not appear to be any useful way to relate the ""closeness"" of n^a and n^b even if a and b are close."

However I can't see how, for only one plaintext ciphertext pair and given a weak/linear internal round function - it is easy to gain the key?

I've read some methods to do with gaussian elimination, however i don't see how that would be possible in practice?

In addition to this, I'm not sure i understand how S-boxes and the internal function are related, because if I pick an internal function such as a bitwise operation, or some other tangible function of the round key and the plaintext block, where do the S-boxes come in?

So for some brief background, we've been working on a proposal for NISTs recently open call for PQC digital signatures.

The C reference instance now has all the functionality described in the whitepaper.   I conjecture sEU-CMA level 5 bits of security with 2400 byte public keys and 645 byte signatures.  Performance is close to the reference instance if DILITHUM5.

My question is what tools are available for trying to actually mount a CMA?  Formal cryptanalysis isn't really my bag.  The signature API comes from directly from NIST, so I assume there must be some tools that can be wired up and can probe for weakness?  All I've done so far is regular linear cryptanalysis with incrementing inputs and checking signatures for statistical randomness.

I have and embedded system with a hard stack frame size of a couple of kilobytes and I am trying to deploy Monocypher on it.

There is a particular function, crypto\_argon2i\_general(), which exceeds that limit due to a few huge buffers that are on the stack.

I don't want to put those buffers in data or bss, as otherwise they will have a fixed location and that would make life easier for potential attackers.

I am allocating them dynamically on the heap using the memory allocator I have available. Every time the function is called, the address of those buffers would possibly be different from before, as the system memory might be in a completely different state each time.

I am not an expert in cryptography or similar. Are there any potential problems with this approach that  I should be aware of? Would  my system be less secure than using the original stack-allocated-buffers option ? If so, how much less?

Thank you :-)"

We’re excited to introduce [Backbone](https://backbone.dev/) — our project aiming to make end-to-end encryption (E2EE) ubiquitous and easy to use (and hard to abuse).

We’ve seen the impact that E2EE has had on the instant messaging space and have yearned for the tooling to build other classes of applications with better privacy guarantees without constantly reinventing the wheel. After multiple revisions and internal audits, Backbone is a robust and resilient cryptographic kernel to underpin end-to-end encrypted applications.

We’ve implemented granular access controls over a key-value store and a streaming engine, with plans to add more data structure primitives to simplify the development of E2EE applications.

Our aim is to eventually support an ecosystem of applications on top of Backbone that provide privacy and security by design; from your organization’s kanban application, password and secret manager, organization service meshes all the way to your personal health monitoring application. All these use cases need to store and share data, ideally without streaming it into the cloud in plaintext to await the next data breach.

Backbone is designed to reduce the need to trust third parties — it operates under a strict threat model, providing confidentiality, integrity and nonrepudiatiability even under the assumption that Backbone itself is pwned. We’re dedicated to operating transparently, leading us to build our [open-source client](https://github.com/backbone-hq/backbone-python) on top of [libsodium](https://doc.libsodium.org/).

We’d love to get your thoughts, opinions and critique over on our [Discord community](https://discord.com/invite/36M4yb6XSG).

Help us build the infrastructure to give the next generation of applications a backbone."

I'm a second year engineering student who knows very little about cryptography but who understands  it as being an important aspect of our society (and of its future). 

I had questions that I wanted to ask about cryptography. Namely what is the best way to dive into such an intimidating topic? I know with things like this you're often forced into the deep end relatively early on, but I also know that pointers from experienced people can save you a lot of wasted time. 

Also, I have a question: some time ago I ran into an idea referred to as ""one person one vote"". It's a theoretical structure in which each participant in a network gets just one vote (towards or against some action or event), cheating is very hard, and the scale can be very large (thousands or even millions of people, institutions, etc.). How big a deal is this within the cryptography community? Is anyone working on this? If so, how far along are they and what are the challenges?"

I understand rsautl is deprecated, but pkeyutl doesn't appear to have the -oaep option that is required to make this work. Basically, I have encrypted text encoded in Base64, and after converting this to Binary in PowerShell, the above command works to decrypt it through CMD. I need the equivalent of this for JS in Node.js. I have found leads on this, but am struggling with the syntax of making all of this function successfully (especially with a pre-determined private key which is in PEM format that needs to be utilized, not generated). The encrypted text will be pulled out of an object and saved as a string inside a variable. The private key will be stored as an environment variable, pulled into the runtime code, and saved into a variable for code execution. The decrypted output just needs to be stored in another variable for use after decryption, not saved as an additional file. I have been looking into the NPM package ""openssl-nodejs"" as well as ""crypto.privateDecrypt(privateKey, buffer)"" using the native crypto package, but cannot seem to find any simpler tutorials of examples which would fit my required use case.

Additionally, if the JS equivalent of the above code similarly decrypts Binary and cannot be specified to decrypt Base64, then I may also need assistance with any additional JS code to make the conversion of the encrypted message.

My questions are:

1. If #KeyInfo is in <Reference> tag that means the <KeyInfo> section is being signed too? (Because wiki says ""One or more Reference elements specify the resource being signed by URI reference""). That leads to the second question
2. If signature value signs both data in tags <KeyInfo> and <Object>, what is getting signed actually? Is it just hashes of these two parts of the xml that were computed and that are in <DigestValue> tag, or is it the whole tags starting from <KeyInfo> and till </KeyInfo> closing tag with the data between it? (same question with <Object>).

Wiki doesn't specify such things and I got lost in RFC and can't find the answers to these questions."

And at what point. What are the flaws of it ? What can I do to improve it ?

It works like that :

Let's take a sentance, for exemple : ""I am going to the supermarket !""

**Step 1** : Remove punctuation and majuscules (my code can only handle letters). We have ""i am going to the supermarket""

**Step 2** : Separate words who has more than 6 letters in packages of 6 letters (you'll understand why later), so we have ""i am going to the superm,arket"" (I use "","" to separate packages of letters).

**Step 3** : Write numbers at the place of the letters (their place in the alphabet, for exemple ""a"" = 1, ""b"" = 2 etc...), so, we get ""9  1.13  7.15.9.14.7  20.15  20.8.5  19.21.16.5.18.13,1.18.11.5.20""

**Step 4** : Convert those numbers in base 27 (I know it's not clear but I show you an exemple).

9 = 9 x 27\^0

1.13 = 1 x 27\^1 + 13 x 27\^0 = 40

7.15.9.14.7 = 7 x 27\^4 + 15 x 27\^3 + 9 x 27\^2 + 14 x 27\^1 + 7 x 27\^0 = 4 022 278

We get ""9 40 4022278 555 14801 284108566,893909""

I separate long words (more than 6 letters) into packages of 6 letters because it would give too longs numbers otherwise (this was intended to be did on a middle school calculator and you need exact numbers to be able to decipher the code later).

**Step 5 :** Replace spaces by "";"". We get that ""9;404022278;555;14801;284108566,893909""

So we ciphered our sentance

I am going to the supermarket ! = 9;404022278;555;14801;284108566,893909

&#x200B;

Now to decipher, we have to do that in reverse :

**Step 1** : Put spaces instaed of "";"". We have ""9 40 4022278 555 14801 284108566,893909""

**Step 2** : Reput the numbers  of each package in ""base 10"". Like this :

9 = 27\^0 x 9 = 9

40 = 27\^1 x 1 + 27\^0 x 13 = 1.13

4 022 278 = 7 x 27\^4 + 15 x 27\^3 + 9 x 27\^2 + 14 x 27\^1 + 7 x 27\^0 = 7.15.9.14.7

(I hope you understood what I meanned by that, if not you can ask me)

We get ""9  1.13  7.15.9.14.7  20.15  20.8.5  19.21.16.5.18.13,1.18.11.5.20""

**Step 3** : Convert back the numbets in letters (1 = ""a"", 2 = ""b"" etc...)

We have ""i am going to the superm,arket""

**Step 4** : Remove the "","" in the words. We get ""i am going to the supermarket""

We deciphered it.

9;404022278;555;14801;284108566,893909 = i am going to the supermarket

&#x200B;

I don't think it's a good algorithm but it's still interesting to know what do you think about this and all.

More info, I give that to some people (my friend for exemple) and nobody has deciphered it but it was people from 9th grade without great knowledge of cryptology so voilà."

What I'm asking myself is whether I can fix some prime p, which fixes the Hasse interval, pick *any* value from that interval, and know that there exists a curve with that number of points over the field F_p.

I think that at least a probabilistic argument might be possible assuming that the order of elliptic curves behaves uniformly random. As the number of possible curve parameters (e.g., for short Weierstrass curves `p^2`) is significantly bigger than the Hasse interval (which is only `2sqrt(p)` in width), it is likely that every value is possible.

But I'm not sure whether this assumption is true."

Particularly, I've been looking at the properties of Deniabilty and identity protection

**Deniability**

So, it's my intution that using signatures in general does not give you deniability, since you have a signature to prove that an exchange took place.

But the specification says this:

>X3DH doesn't give either Alice or Bob a publishable cryptographic proof of the contents of their communication or the fact that they communicated.

But in the initial ""prekey bundle"" bob is sending his prekey signature, signed with his identiity key. Does this not give a proof that bob has been involved in the exchange?

**Identity protection**

This one is a bit more simple, but I can't find anyone writing about it anywhere.

Both of the public identity keys of bob and alice is sent freely, as described by the protocol.

This, in my mind, straight up prevents identity protection, simply because the identites of both parties are in the public domain.

But would'nt this be a desireable feature for a app like Signal which prides itself in being as anonymous as possible?

The protocol allows you to select between different cipher suites, one based on aes-ccm and one on aes-gcm.

And it says the following about ccm:

>Cipher suites 0-3, based on AES-CCM, are intended for constrained       IoT where message overhead is a very important factor

So, in my understanding GCM is overall better, since it authenticates on the ciphertext, and is parralelizable.

But why would ccm be better for constrained devices?

In the quote I have here, it seems like it has to do with smaller messages size, but GCM can have a tag tag is 64 bits, and uses a 12 byte nonce. aes-ccm uses 64 bit tags and 13 byte nonces.

Seems like gcm could provide the same message sizes.

So does GCM use a whole lot of memory or what is the case?

where `h` is the authentication key computed from the AES-GCM key and the ciphertexts are ordered backwards, ignoring aad for simplicity. Thus, one can compute the authentication key `h` by finding the factors of the polynomial whose coefficients are public information (the ciphertext itself), which directly gives the roots of the polynomial (though there may be more than one, there's usually only a few).

Cryptopals claims (https://cryptopals.com/sets/8/challenges/63.txt) (and I've observed in empirical testing) that the authentication keys will only appear in the first-degree factors, so if we end up with the factors `(y^2+a)(y+b)(y+c)`, for example, the authentication key could only be `b` or `c`. 

Why is this the case; why can't the other-degree factors contain the authentication key?

2303,"How is ECC more secure than RSA, with the same key sizes?",12,x03gj4,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/x03gj4/how_is_ecc_more_secure_than_rsa_with_the_same_key/,7,2022-08-29 00:44:55,"Hi

One of the things you often hear about ECC vs RSA-based schemes, is that ECC offers more security with smaller keys than RSA.

I found this table for reference:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/xn8vixwo6ik91.png?width=567&format=png&auto=webp&s=4c3ca56d006462efd116cf90bad6e134a0ace651

But, in my mind, breaking a scheme would amount to bruteforcing it long enough to guess the key.

In this light, I don't understand how the same keysize can offer differing amounts of security, depending on the cryptosystem. A 128-bit key would always take n seconds to guess, no matter if we were using RSA, ECC, AES or something else.

Guessing a random bitstring will always take the same time, no matter the scheme, is my thought,

So, given this, how can one scheme provide more security per bit, than another scheme? With a focus on ECC

&#x200B;

**EDIT:**

So I was googling a bit more around and found something that could amount to an answer for this, but a bit ambiguous.

So the reason different schemes offer more or less security for the same keyssize, is that you would'nt use straight up brute forcing for breaking them.

For RSA, you need to solve integer factorization, which can be done relatively fast (still exponential running time, but compared to other cryptosystems)

For ECC, we need to solve elliptic curve discrete log problem, which there exists no fast ways to do"

2305,Have thought of a (hopefully useful) cipher spec. Looking for some suggestions!,6,wzfuog,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/wzfuog/have_thought_of_a_hopefully_useful_cipher_spec/,10,2022-08-28 04:22:16,"First of all, many thanks for all the suggestions you guys gave me in the last post I made, I really appreciate it.

The cipher I've thought of works like this:

1.	The input is first divided into blocks of equal length (this length is the block size), let's call this array of arrays of bytes **i**
2.	Generate an IV with a length equal to the block size.
3.	By using Argon2 (setting the output length to be equal to the block size), you generate a derived key using the IV as the salt and the key as the password, I'll call this **d**
4.	Create an empty array of length equal to the block size that will be filled later with the encrypted blocks, let's call it **e**
5.	Iterate through the input (i), let's call each block x and the offset of the block n
6.	Calculate the keyed hash of the last encrypted block in the array (e\[last\]) and the derived key (d) (if there's no encrypted block in the array yet, the IV will be used instead), the output will be called **h**
7.	Calculate the block's counter by computing the keyed hash of the the current block number (n) and the derived key (d), I'll call the output of this **c**
8.	Make a copy of the derived key (d), I'll call this **d1**
9.	Move all the elements of the copy of the derived key (d1) one step to the right
10. Calculate the xor of the block's counter (c) and the copy of the derived key (d1) and move the output to the counter (c).
11. Go back to step 8 many times as you want (it must be a constant number of times, these are the rounds).
12. Calculate the xor of the counter (c) and the last encrypted block keyed hash (h) and move the output to the counter (c).
13. Calculate the xor of the input's current block (x) and the counter (c), and the output will be used to calculate another xor with the last block keyed hash (h).
14. The output of step 13 is then concatenated with the encrypted data array (e).
15. Go back to step 5 and repeat!
16. Concatenate the IV, the encrypted data (e) and keyed hash of the encrypted data (e) and the derived key (d)

Btw, when calculating the xor, the elements of the derived key or the counter (step 13) will be repeated until both inputs have the same length.

Also, if the input can't be divided into blocks of equal length, the last block can be shorter.

Sorry if the explanation was a bit messy... anyways, [here is the implementation of the spec](https://github.com/nv0skar/Komatta) for you to try!

I've had to make a few design decisions which I don't know if they're the right choice:

1.	The derived key is calculated by using Argon2 (is it better for hashing private keys?)
2.	The keyed hash is an HMAC using Blake3 (outputting a hash of the same length as the block size)

The reason why I'm using HMAC instead of [Blake3's Keyed Hash function](https://docs.rs/blake3/latest/blake3/fn.keyed_hash.html) is because I've noticed that the function only accepts keys of a maximum length of 32 bytes, and if I'm using the derived key (which has the same length as the block size), if the block size is larger than 32 bytes it won't fit as a parameter.

So my questions are:

1.	In this cipher's context (which doesn't have to check if the derived key is valid or not), shall I use HMAC with Blake3, [Blake3's Key Derivation function](https://docs.rs/blake3/latest/blake3/fn.derive_key.html)  or Argon2 for deriving a key? Are there others I should consider?
2.	Does this cipher make sense for a cryptographic standpoint? Or it has already pwned features which may result into being insecure?

Thanks for your help!

So, I recently did a project where we implemented a protocol. A part of this protocol was using [HKDF's](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5869.html) to generate keys from ECDH shared secrets.

Now, I benchmarked this project, and found that using HKDF extract, and expand was pretty slow, compared to other primitives, such as authenticated encryption with aes-ccm, or straight hashing with sha256.

ECDH shared secret generation was by far the slowest though.

&#x200B;

But, since applying HKDF extract and expand was so slow, I was wondering whether we could'nt just replace it with some faster primitive.

In my mind, the only requirements for a KDF is the following:

1. It is a one-way function
2. It is a Cryptographicallly secure pseudo random function
3. We can get a output key of any length we want (in this case 256 bits)

&#x200B;

I was thinking that either a good hash function, or just a hmac could provide exactly the same benefits, since they a one-way functions etc.

And that would then be much faster.

Am i correct?"

To give it a try, I've implemented the cipher I understood from the video. ~~Here is the repo~~ **I deleted the repo as it was just a XOR cipher with HMAC authentication, and I was looking for other properties like key reusing, that when paired with a XOR cipher [is fairly easy to decrypt](https://arpitbhayani.me/blogs/decipher-repeated-key-xor)! So I'll keep looking at ways of improving the cipher, and as soon as I have the specification and an implementation I'll share it with you guys! **.

The encryption I've implemented works the following way:

1.	Calculate the hash of the key + input using Blake3
2.	Calculate the xor of the key and input + hash. If input + hash is longer that the key, the elements of the key will be repeated until they have both the same length

All the inputs and the output must be byte arrays (The program actually returns the hexadecimal form of that byte array).

My questions are:

* Is the cypher I implemented actually HMAC, assuming not, how it differs from the actual thing?
* And from a first glance, is what I implemented safe? Can it be abused? If so, how can it be broken?"

Supersingular Isogeny Key Encapsulation (SIKE), a family of PQC algorithms involving elliptic curves that NIST recently added to PQC competition, is now broken.

SIKE is a form of isogeny-based cryptography based on the Supersingular Isogeny Diffie-Hellman (SIDH) key exchange protocol. “SIDH/SIKE was one of the first practical isogeny-based cryptographic protocols,” Decru says.

However, one of SIKE’s vulnerabilities was that in order for it to work, it needed to provide extra information to the public known as auxiliary torsion points. “Attackers have tried to exploit this extra information for a while, but had not been successful in using it to break SIKE,” Moody says. “However, this new paper found a way to do it, using some pretty advanced mathematics.”

I'm writing this post because I lately have been reading up on the LoRaWAN protocol.

So here, it is basically claimed that the usage of ECB is fine, because it mixes in two nonces, which are two-octet counting/incrementing nonces. And therefore we won't have the issue that the same plaintext will result in the same ciphertext.

This seems like a strangely simple fix, ands doesnt seem to me like it should work.

Does mixing in a couple of nonces in the ECB encryption ""fix"" the issues that are present with ECB mode?"

I have been thinking about one particular cryptosystem for a few years now and I was wondering if it was easily breakable or not.

So first, you should have an array of easily computable mathematical constants. Then, with pseudo-random numbers, you create a tree of operations on these constants and you get a non-trivial constant, like (e^(π*1.3879)+2.907109)/(ζ(3)+4.887*sqrt(7)) but in more complicated. Compute this complicated constant in base 26 (or higher) and you have a pseudo one-time pad for use.

In practical terms, Alice would first need to meet Bob to convene of a first constant (or one-time-pad) to use. Then each time a message is sent, a new constant is written by the sender at the end of the message (in literal form) and in option the position of the first digit of the pad could be written.

Currently going through the book ""Programming Bitcoin by Jimmy Song"", got stuck on page 61 (Chapter 3), but completed the exercise 5 from chapter 3. You can view the source code [here](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/programming-bitcoin/9781492031482/preface01.html#setting_up), or in [Github](https://github.com/jimmysong/programmingbitcoin)

Even though the book is great for understanding cryptographic different concepts, highly abstracted OOP code from the book makes it somewhat harder to gaining the intuition of the fundamental low-level concepts behind key principles. That's why apart from completing exercises, I like to also code my own procedural functions that solve the same problems.

The main function uses ""Binary expansion"" technique, but it seems like the problem lies in the ""Addition"" function that doesn't have it.

To see some results I copied OOP code from the book, refactored it a bit uploaded to github and it works:

I recently got posting privileges on this sub, so I apologize if anything is out of line with the subreddit's purposes.

Background: Since I like programing projects that are math heavy, I decided to take on implementing RSA encryption from scratch as a hobby project. My approach to any project is to take a simple case, and once that works, I generalize it to be increasingly more complex.

What I am asking: are the steps I followed from [this source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)#Key_generation) done correctly? So far, I have just tried to implement the algorithm step by step (1 through 5) using trivial prime numbers. The code is given here:

    #include <stdio.h>
    #include <stdlib.h>
    
    //Function for finding greatest common divisor
    //Seems to work just fine.
    int gcd(int a, int b) {
        int mod;
        while (b != 0) {
            mod = a%b;
            a = b;
            b = mod;
        }
    
        return a;
    }
    
    //Using Euler's function for finding lowest common multiple
    //This also seems to work
    int lcm(int a, int b) {
        return abs(a*b)/gcd(a, b);
    }
    
    //magic code, I'll look into how this works
    //src: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/multiplicative-inverse-under-modulo-m/
    //Finds modular multiplicative inverse 
    int mod_inverse(int a, int m) {
    
        int m0 = m;
        int y = 0, x = 1;
    
        if (m == 1) {
            return 0;
        }
    
        while (a > 1) {
            int q = a / m;
            int t = m;
    
            m = a % m, a = t;
            t = y;
    
            y = x - q * y;
            x = t;
        }
    
        if(x < 0) {
            x+=m0;
        }
    
        return x;
    }
    //Driver code
    int main() {
        int i;
        int p, q;  //primes for keys
       
        //trivial vals used, 13 not good with 7 as it makes e = d, can cause confusion
        p = 17;
        q = 7;
        int n = p*q;
    
        //Carmimichael's totient function
        //n = p*q so lambda(n) = lcm(lambda(p), lambda(q))
        //since p, q are prime, then lambda(n) = lcm(p-1, q-1)
        
        int totient = lcm(p-1, q-1);
    
        //find int e such that 1 < e < totient
        //and gcd(e, totient) = 1, which implies
        //e, totient are coprime
        int e;
        int es[totient]; //es as in plural of ""e""
        //fill array with all positive integers from 1 to totient-1.
        for(i = 0; i < totient; i++) {
            es[i] = i+1;
        }
        //i = 1 is necessary since 1 < e < totient is a condition
        //if i = 0, 1 automatically is picked, which we do not want
        for(i = 1; i < totient; i++) {
            //this stop condition finds an appropriate value for d
            if(gcd(es[i], totient) == 1) { 
                e = es[i];
                break;
            }
        }
    
        int d = mod_inverse(e, totient);
    
        //stuff for printing the various values I have found
        printf(""prime p: %d\nprime q: %d\n"", p, q);
        printf(""modulus n: %d\n"", n);
        printf(""totient: %d\n"", totient);
        printf(""e: %d\n"", e);
        printf(""d: %d"", d);
    
    
        return 0;
    }

This is only one small piece, but there's a lot to be implemented to make the key as I have to implement a padding scheme. If using trivial primes is fine for proof of concept, I will implement cryptographically secure pseudo random number generation (CSPRNG) once I find out how to generate a random seed using hardware RNG.

I am no expert, but the gist of it, as far as I can tell, is this: imagine a fake root certificate authority is installed on the client's computer. Then suppose that when the client goes to do a TLS Connection to, say, google.com, it can be intercepted. This would normally be detected since no valid certificate could be presented for the fake private/public key pair that would be necessary to initiate the TLS session. But since a fake root certificate authority has been installed, the fake CA can sign the bogus certificate to google. 

So basically, someone can snoop on any TLS Connections, as well as modify them, since the client has a root certificate authority that will sign off on bogus certificates that the client will trust.

Normally, we can check to see if this is happening by verifying the fingerprints of certificates, as mentioned in the above link. If the fingerprints match, then it is a legitimate certificate and not one generated by a bogus CA. 

My question is, can something comparable happen with VPN connections? What would be the analogous method of detecting that this is going on. Is there a fingerprint that could be checked? It seems relatively common that employers, or other entities, use TLS interception to monitor network traffic. And I assume many people think that if they are using a VPN, they are safe from any interception, since theoretically they have a secure encrypted connection with the VPN provider. But could employers or other entities not do the exact same thing as TLS interception, except with a VPN connection?

I use openvpn and would appreciate any advice for openvpn specifically as well."

2347,Looking for the name of a specific construct,12,w9yhb2,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/w9yhb2/looking_for_the_name_of_a_specific_construct/,5,2022-07-28 08:45:48,"Hi, I have an idea that I would like to do some research on, but I am not sure what exactly it is called, so I am hoping if any one of you know what I am talking about. From now on I am just gonna refer to this construct as a ""trapdoor sequence"". Basically you have a sequence aᵢ, and given an element of the sequence aₙ, one can only efficiently compute aₘ, where m < n without some secret information, whereas someone with the secret information can compute any element of the sequence. 

This is useful in my scenario where users are assigned with private keys, where each private keys are only valid for a specific epoch. So given a private key of epoch t, the user can compute all the private keys before that epoch (private keys used in the past), however only the private key generator (PKG) can compute private keys after that epoch (private keys in the future). This allows the PKG to effectively assign keys that would expire after a specific epoch.

I think this kinda of ""trapdoor sequence"" can be constructed with something similar to RSA, where aᵢ = x\^(d\^i) mod n, where n and the exponential inverse of d (e) are public parameters. So say the PKG wants to assign a user with a private key at epoch 123, the PKG randomly chooses x and has a static secret d, and computes k = x \^ d¹²³. The user would be given k and uses it to encrypt stuff for epoch 123. If the user wants the private key at epoch 122. then they can compute k\^e = x \^ (d¹²³ \* e) = x \^ d¹²². The user can repeats to compute the private key for any epoch less than 123, but not above 123, since they do not know the value of d. 

I am wondering if there also exists something similar but for elliptic curves, where given aₙP, aₘP for m < n can be efficiently computed, but not m > n without secret knowledge. To my knowledge the method I described would not work for EC since it relies on the group order being hidden from the users. I tried searching for ""trapdoor sequences"" but I can't find any relevant results. Does anyone know if such a thing exist?"

>[This paper](https://cr.yp.to/papers/pqrsa-20170419.pdf) assumes that astonishingly scalable quantum computers will be built, making a qubit operation as inexpensive as a bit operation.

The idea of pqRSA is that the quantum complexity of Shor's algorithm scales quadratically with the size of the modulus, because it requires raising a number to an exponent on the order of the modulus squared. The paper implies that, in order to meet it's criteria, it must be infeasible for a classical computer to do 4 log\_2 N group operations. I am going to say that it must approximately be infeasible for a classical computer to compute 1.5 log\_2 N group operations.

Let us say that the accumulator does not need to be collision resistant. A quantum safe hash is required to have 256 bit long output to achieve 128 bit security. Any prime derived from a hash should also be at least that size.

Because 1.5 log\_2 N group operations are infeasible to compute, it is infeasible to to compute an average hamming weight exponent of similar magnitude to N, and therefor it is infeasible to accumulate log\_2 N / 256 primes.

Because at least one group member (an integer modulo N) must be sent to the verifier, and a few group operations must be performed to do any verification, Merkle branches are more efficient if their size is less than a group member. We have determined that we can not accumulate more than log\_2 N / 256 values with pqRSA. However, if we concatenate log\_2 N /256 hashes, we get a total size no greater than that of a group element. If the concatenated hashes are not sorted, it should still be cheaper to look up a hash than to perform a group operation. This also applies for proving non-membership, because checking every hash is also cheaper than a group operation.

Now I am curious if a similar argument applies for VDFs/time-locks with pqRSA. I guess it depends on the circuit depth of asymptotically fast multiplication algorithms but I don't know how they work."

Enigma 4 ( custom scramble motors, Rotor 3 set to V, rotor 4 set II etc) this is then fed into a Ceasar cipher shift 9 ( a->j) which is then fed into another enigma 4 again with a combination of mix rotors and even plugboard.  the output in text is say something like.

Security against active adversaries means that even if a certain amount (up to a predefined threshold) parties collude to deviate from the protocol, the inputs are still secret, and the outputs correct (if the protocol didn't abort). If the threshold for corrupted (or crashed) parties is less than half, the condition of robustness can be added, meaning that the protocol does in fact terminate and yield the correct result.

In general, protocols without active security are more efficient. I have noticed that some things, like switching between rings, are inefficient or impossible to do with security against an active majority, but relatively easy to do with security against a passive majority, mainly because the output can't be authenticated.

In many cases, there is a way to confirm that an output is correct more easily than it was to compute the output. Is there any literature or compiling a protocol to secrecy against active adversaries with out worrying about the correctness of the output?"

This is technically a protocol which relies on different primitives for different part of it and those primitives can be changed.

In which case, what purpose does the root certificate's signature have? Is the root certificate signed with priv1, or is it signed with another key priv0? Using priv0, and not disclosing pub0 feels like a potential artifact of a strategy for introducing new root certificates (as the children of old root certificates).

The rest of the protocol seems pretty straight forward, and it would make since to do most of it in SPDZ2k. There is one problem though: I will inevitably have to calculate something akin `[trap door] = powmod(2, 2**60, [totient])`. There are many different approaches I can take to this but it will require at least one division by a \~4000 bit integer.

I have no experience with cryptography; although when I get the chance I'm going to take the Cryptography I class on Coursera. I'm just a game developer who wants to attempt to make his games a little more cheat proof. I asked a question here before, and you were all very helpful. Thank you!

But right now I have another question about a game I'm working on where I want to establish a leaderboard for players. Whether or not I can get this to work without the threat of cheating will affect my decision to reward players who get to the top of it.

At the beginning of the game I create an array of random (but never duplicated) integers within a certain range. This array is used to set up the game and everything else is based on it. Therefore, when the game is over, if I collect information from the user, they should end up with the same array of integers that I can compare to make sure they're the same.

In order to make the win scenario secure, I was thinking about using two AWS Lambda calls. The first one would create the array, serialize it and record it in the database, and return it to the client. The second would take the array that the player assembles at the end of the game, compares it to the array in the database and decides if the game was victorious.

My question for you all is whether or not this sounds reasonable. I've done a little bit of research into using one of the SHA hash functions to create an object out of the initial array, and then use it in the second Lambda to check it against the new array.

Another thought I just had was that maybe I could create the array and reorder it using some custom reordering algorithm that's not obvious (not just ascending or descending), since when I initially create it, it's completely unordered and randomized within it's bounds. That way, I can take the initial array, reorder it in that first way, serialize it and save it to the database, and then reorder it in an ascending order, which is what I would send back to the client. Then the client would play through the game, recreating an array with the same numbers but in an order based on how the player does it. Then when the player completes the game, the array he assembled by playing the game is sent to the lambda, put through the unique sorting algorithm and checked against what is stored in the database.

I think the second option should work fine, but what do you think? Is that a good solution to the problem that makes it so that I don't have to rely on a server to abstract the game logic from the client? If what I wrote isn't making sense, let me know and I can clarify for you."
2393,Homomorphic encryption and electronic voting,32,vheo95,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/vheo95/homomorphic_encryption_and_electronic_voting/,31,2022-06-21 20:00:25,"A long time ago I learned from a uni professor that you could leverage homomorphic encryption to perform e-voting without compromising anonymity and integrity.

Recently I remembered that and thought ""Piece of cake. For each vote, encrypt a 0 for every other candidate. For the candidate that is voted for, encrypt a 1. Then you perform homomorphic addition on every vote per candidate, decrypt the result and you got the tally"".

This presents 2 problems however:

* Encrypted 0s and 1s are gonna have the same ciphertext respectively. And if you try to pad or fuzz the plaintexts then the homomorphic addition is going to fail because the values will no longer be 0 and 1.
* If you have the private key to decrypt the tally, then you can use that key to decrypt individual votes as well.

So how does it actually work ? I tried answering that by reading papers but either they didn't provide an answer or I got lost in maths. Thanks."

2396,Initial impact report about this week's EdDSA Double-PubKey Oracle attack in 40 affected crypto libs,110,vfl2se,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/vfl2se/initial_impact_report_about_this_weeks_eddsa/,32,2022-06-19 07:48:56,"Last week MystenLabs crypto research revealed a list of 26 Ed25519 libraries that could expose the  private key if the signing function was misused either accidentally or on purpose. **As of today and thanks to community contribution, this list currently includes 40 libraries** from almost every programming language, some of them very popular with 100+ Github stars.

TL;DR the report revealed that the signing api of many ed25519 libs (some of them very popular) unfortunately expects a public key as input. An attacker may extract the private key by requesting two different signatures for the same message and private key, but on purpose for a different public key. Applications should not expose this api publicly and should refactor it to protect devs against accidental api misuse.

# What happened this week, who is really affected, who took action?

In the first few minutes after this [tweet on June 11th](https://twitter.com/kostascrypto/status/1535579208960790528) around a potential EdDSA exploit, MystenLabs' research team immediately received emails, Signal, Telegram, Twitter, Whatsapp, Slack messages, even phone calls to help, clarify and recommend fixes on various affected open-source and close-source projects that make use of the potentially unsafe api.

Since then, a 7 days marathon started to check what and who is affected.

* Notable cryptographers and security experts (theorists and engineers), including Henry de Valence, Tony Arcieri, Foteini Baldimtsi, Lera Nikolaenko and Riyaz Faizullabhoy verified the claim, proposed non-affected libraries, and they also recommended workarounds. Thank you all for volunteering to contribute by transferring your precious knowledge and experience
* More than 30 blockchain startups, devs, banks, fintech, wallet providers and audit companies reached out and I hope they were all consulted with respect and always voluntarily (no paid service) re impact in their software and how to track misuse
* Unfortunately, dozens of services across the globe expose the exploitable EdDSA api and they are looking for fixes/refactoring or adding api comments to protect their devs and users. There is NDA in place, but you probably know some of them :)
* Unfortunately, it's not always possible to apply updates, i.e., there was an interesting case with an IoT vendor - they just optimistically hope it won't be exploited due to small financial benefit the attacker can gain - that's because they're not big to be a target)
* Trezor's hardware wallet firmware allows the affected api, but there was a deep dive by both the  this attack's author (Kostas) and the Trezor team; they all eventually realized that current ed25519 signing invocations are fortunately safe. Thus, **no worries at the moment, Trezor's current firmware is secure against this threat**, but  their engineers are working on deprecating the affected function to prevent any accidental future misuse - Github tracking issue [https://github.com/trezor/trezor-firmware/issues/2338](https://github.com/trezor/trezor-firmware/issues/2338). I'd highlight that Trezor's response and cooperation was indeed blazing fast, good job guys!
* There is an analogy between fault attacks and this attack vector (the Double pubKey Oracle exploit has the same effect with fault injections, but it's easier to apply Vs side channels, while we still don't know if they can even be combined in an orchestrated attack)
* Even correct implementations can be vulnerable, but we'll cover that in the future (TL;DR one provider we examined didn't protect their pubKeys with the same integrity mechanism as their privKeys, and thus the pubKey part is loaded from a potentially unsafe config which might have been corrupted already - so coupling the keys before signing is not gonna protect them, it's already too late - they are working on a release update)
* Due to the above we shouldn't assume that signing with a coupled keyPair is always safe, it really depends on how the pair was constructed/loaded in the first place. There is a community debate if we should also enlist these apis that don't provide the pubKey separately to sign function, but still couple them in a keyPair just before signing or without equal priv/pub key integrity guarantees.
* **MOST important LESSON**: we have received feedback that the concept behind this exploit extends outside EdDSA's sphere. Many deterministic cryptographic protocols that take the pubKey as input to their proof generation function, might need to ensure the pubKey hasn't been corrupted
* It's perfectly normal to store pubKeys inside privKeys, I guess many of you haven't realized it, but we already do that in RSA, see [https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/21102/what-is-the-ssl-private-key-file-format](https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/21102/what-is-the-ssl-private-key-file-format) (the privKey carries the pubKey part as well)
* Actually, there is an analogy between the recent `ed25519.sign(msg, privKey, pubKey)` exploit & a hypothetical `rsa.sign(msg, privKey, N)` where `N` (modulo) would be provided independently. A faulty `N` would reveal the rsa privKey, see [https://eprint.iacr.org/2011/388.pdf](https://eprint.iacr.org/2011/388.pdf) , and for a Layman terms explanation check the related ppt: [https://www.normalesup.org/\~tibouchi/papers/talk-modulusfault.pdf](https://www.normalesup.org/~tibouchi/papers/talk-modulusfault.pdf)
* A potential (but expensive) workaround that has been proposed in the past (mentioned in a related libsodium thread many years ago) is verifying the signature before outputting it. But unfortunately that wouldn't suffice and can be bypassed. In fact, it would probably work for random CPU fault attacks (i.e. Row hammer), but not when an adversary can pick the public key wisely. TL;DR one can provide as input, a mixed order pubKey (original pubKey in which we added a *small-order* point) and unfortunately the signature would still verify. The [*Taming the many EdDSAs*](https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/1244.pdf) paper published in Security Standardization Research Conference (SSR 2020) - page 11, explains why this is possible when we use co-factored signature verification.
* But I'll close this fact-list with a statement that the blockchain community has proven one more time how important its contribution is for the evolution of cryptography science and security enhancements outside the blockchain space. The interest and volunteerism spirit of many important people in the space is remarkable. There are also unsung heroes in this story and we're lucky we didn't have (yet) a big news like the [Playstation 3 ECDSA hack](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-12116051) (more soon or hopefully never).

Note: the issue in not in the algorithm, EdDSA is one of the best and secure schemes out there, and the majority of software we examined is generally safe. But there is a gap and broken phone inconsistencies between:

* [original DJ Bernstein et al paper](https://ed25519.cr.yp.to/ed25519-20110926.pdf) (which does not explain if the public key is an input or not to the signing function)
* EdDSA authors' demo [ed25519 python impl](https://ed25519.cr.yp.to/python/ed25519.py) (which expects the public key as extra input to the signing function - vulnerable to this exploit)
* EdDSA authors' [ref10 C sign.c](https://github.com/floodyberry/supercop/blob/master/crypto_sign/ed25519/ref10/sign.c#L7) (private key carries the public key, so it seems safe)
* other popular implementations, mainly [ed25519-donna (C)](https://github.com/floodyberry/ed25519-donna/blob/master/ed25519.c#L59) and [ed25519-dalek (Rust)](https://github.com/dalek-cryptography/ed25519-dalek/blob/main/src/secret.rs#L399) (where `.sign` function expects both priv and pub keys (potentially decoupled) as inputs - vulnerable to this exploit)
* Official EdDSA [RFC 8032](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8032#section-5.1.6) (where the pubKey is expected to be computed inside the signing function - safe but adds an extra scalar2point multiplication + additional pubKey serialization cost to the signing function)
* Incompatibility between implementations on what is considered the EdDSA privKey (the initial seed? the extended private key? the KeyPair itself (to avoid reconstructing the pubKey on each sign operation)?
* Extra feedback about the history of this exploit: Note that even the report's author (Kostas) [had tweeted about that a year ago](https://twitter.com/kostascrypto/status/1426756885152104454?s=20&t=l7EF_iIH5nmnWLHCwP6AeQ) (+ FB's Libra project wrapped ed25519-dalek keys mainly for this purpose), and both him and the community knew about the fault attacks since 2014. It's just that the massive number of still potentially exploitable public apis and the fact that he recently came across a use case where this attack was applicable in practice (the public api expected a `<msg, privKeyID, pubKey>` from any user), triggered a thorough research effort to analyze and report a more complete list of potentially vulnerable libs.

*I'm personally super tired after this insane week of explaining and fixing stuff for friends and firms and will take a few days off next week, so I might be unreachable. There is enough visibility now and we should let admins and crypto devs do their job. Thank you crypto community.*"

I had the following concern about them: permutations fundamentally can be represented as a reversible logic circuit, which one the first glance should defeat the desired ""one-way"" property.

It got resolved for me in the following way: for N-bit permutations there are exist permutations which require at least `(2^N)!/(N!)` gates to be implemented. The bound is number of possible permutations divided by number of N bit shuffles, combining bit shuffle and universal reversible gate in a fixed position and constructing chain from those is a basic and very inefficient way of encoding reversible circuits. The function grows **VERY** fast, meaning that for cryptographically interesting values of N there exist permutations which require astronomic amount of gates to be implemented in a reversible fashion. A strong one-way permutation should be in this class of permutations, while having an alternative representation for ""forward"" computation with a practical amount of gates.

Can you recommend papers which discuss one-way permutations from such angle? I am particularly interested in more precise bounds on number of reversible gates required for implementing all possible N-bit permutations and bounds on maximum ""depth"" of such circuits."

2. That you have created this message

2417,How many Miller-Rabin rounds should be used for RSA primality testing?,26,v6a9d0,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/v6a9d0/how_many_millerrabin_rounds_should_be_used_for/,6,2022-06-07 00:03:46,"I've been reading more about this and apparently, if you are trying to estimate the chance that an odd composite passes a certain number of Miller-Rabin rounds, the worst case estimate is that each round of Miller-Rabin reduces this chance by one fourth. This means that if you want to reduce the chance that your randomly chosen odd is actually composite to less than (1/2)^(128) , then you need to do 64 rounds of Miller-Rabin.

I've recently found a paper titled ""Average case error estimates for the strong probable prime test"" (you can get it [here](https://math.dartmouth.edu/~carlp/PDF/paper88.pdf)) that says in the average case you need much fewer rounds to get the same degree of certainty. The paper gives multiple expressions for calculating the probability that an odd *k*\-bit composite passes a certain number *t* of rounds. This one seems most applicable to RSA:

&#x200B;

>p(k, t) < k^(3/2) \* 2^(t) \* t^(-1/2) \* 4^(2-sqrt(tk))  for t=2 and 88 <= k, or 3 <= t <= k/9 and 21 <= k.

After reading this I wrote some Python code (and added it to my PyRSA hobby code [here](https://gitlab.com/ChrisCalderon/PyRSA/-/blob/master/pyrsa/primes.py#L11)), and for k=1024 I get the I should do 6 rounds of Miller-Rabin to get p(k, t) < (1/2)^(128) . That's a lot less than the 64 rounds the worst case estimate suggests! Is this really good enough for RSA?

Also, does a BPSW test reduce this number further? A BPSW test does Miller-Rabin with base 2 plus a strong Lucas probable prime test (this is what the GMP library does in it's \`mpz\_probab\_prime\_p\`, and their [docs](https://gmplib.org/manual/Number-Theoretic-Functions) seem to imply this reduces the number of Miller-Rabin rounds you need by 24)."

Doing this manually is somewhat nerdy. Most people aren't going to do that.

The questions are as follows:

I have two questions regarding to this paper: ""A Full RNS Variant of Approximate Homomorphic Encryption"". I will refer this paper as 'RNS CKKS'.

Question 1:

The multiplication operation of this paper involve modular raise and modular reduction for relinearlization. I just wonder what is the purpose of these two operations? In the original CKKS scheme (""Homomorphic Encryption for Arithmetic of Approximate Numbers""), our goal is to compute $\\lfloor d\_2\\cdot evk \\cdot P\^{-1} \\rceil mod \\ Q$. However, according to this new RNS CKKS paper, his idea is to compute $\\lfloor d'\_2\\cdot evk \\cdot P\^{-1} \\rceil mod \\ Q$, where $d'\_2=d\_2+e\_1Q$. But,I just wonder why?

Question 2:

In the RNS CKKS paper, the author clearly mentioned that the parameter P is set to be large enough such that the error of the multiplication is low. But, how large should \`P' be set? Is there any resource talking about how to set P? Does the parameter P relates to security level of the CKKS scheme?"

I was wondering what the best encryption is if I just want to encrypt files for myself and decrypt them later. I have no idea about different encryptions but I first looked at AES and found out that I always need a different IV which is very unpractical for every file.

I thought RSA encryption would be better, but it can only encrypt 245 bytes witch is not enough.

So now I would try to combine both by encrypting the IV with RSA and the File with AES, but I don‘t know how I would store the IV. Could I just write it as the first or last bytes of the encrypted file and then remove them again before decrypting?

Thanks in advance for your answers"

I take it a block cipher must encrypt a block of plaintext in polynomial time, but with respect to what parameter (i.e. block size, keylength)?

For example, if I designed a block cipher which encrypts 16 bit (2 byte) blocks, but some internal process of the cipher required 2\^16 (fast) iterations to encrypt, would this qualify as a block cipher?  After all, 2\^16 is not large and encryption would occur ""quickly"", but the number of iterations is exponentially related to the number of bits in the block."

I wondering how to make this secure enough.

By having username and password which will be sent in plain text and available from anyone at routing path to sniff it.

Also, implementing DH mechanism would change rfc on both sides client/server and lead to incompatibilities btw servers and clients, so credentials should be known to both sides in advance.

So what if:

would be enough to use only hash function ""hash(password | client\_public\_ip)"" as password to be sent to server.

Since server knows password in advance, and client public ip is available to grab, it is easy for server to verify if this connection request should be processed or rejected.

Goal is to restrict access to sock5 server others then source knowing the actual password where plain password is never sent in plain text.

HUG is the number one meme coin, and most traded asset on Radix. It’s a movement of positivity in the crypto world with one goal in mind, to spread good vibes, community, and generosity in a space often dominated by FUD, red candles, and wallet drains. HUG aims to fill the void left by the aggressive degen culture, it is designed to be a sustainable and decentralized project, powered by the people, for the people, built on the cutting-edge Radix tech.

**Why HUG on Radix?**

Radix is fast, secure, and scalable – everything a top meme coin needs! It's designed to change how we use decentralized apps with a user-friendly experience that makes interactions smooth and simple. Radix is highly secure, with its simple transaction manifest, you can say goodbye to wallet drains forever.

By being the number one meme coin on Radix, HUG is positioned for success. Just like $BONK and $BRETT, being the top meme coin on a leading network can bring immense recognition and growth. As Radix gains momentum, HUG will lead the charge, spreading positivity and generosity throughout the crypto world.

**Why HUG at all?**

Meme Coins Are the Gateway - The top meme coins on any chain outperform other projects. They’re not just about fun, they’re powerful tools for onboarding new users into the ecosystem. Positive Vibes Narrative - The ethos of ""HUG department always open"" fits perfectly into the Matt Fury meta and was taken from a custom line drawing by Matt. Why are we always open? Because there is always someone that needs a HUG, and the HUG community wants to be there to give it to them. Unique Distribution Mechanism Proof-of-HUG (POH) is HUG's innovative distribution mechanism that ensures a sustainable revenue model using devices like our validator, and trade bot to generate fees. With more than 2/3 of its liquidity provided by over 2,000 community wallets, HUG is truly powered by the people!

Tibia Tokens (TIB) can be obtained by converting Tibia Coins, an in-game currency, through the Tibia Token Exchange. **Built on the BNB Smart Chain and following the ERC20 standard**, Tibia Tokens are compatible with many digital wallets, like MetaMask and applications. This feature opens up a unique opportunity for Tibia players to engage with blockchain technology, blending the lines between virtual and real-world economies. 

While Tibia may not have the massive player count of games like World of Warcraft, it has maintained a dedicated player base with around 10,000 to 20,000 daily active players. Therefore, this might indicate an important step for the gaming and cryptocurrency industries, showing the potential of game economies to integrate with digital asset platforms.

2471,Unmasking NFT Wash Trading,15,1fza9is,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1fza9is/unmasking_nft_wash_trading/,3,2024-10-09 02:20:49,"Dear community,

We're a team of researchers interested in infometrics, chainalysis, or colloquially analysis of blockchain data. I've made this account to post about our recent research on analysis of NFT trading networks and our findings in detecting potential illicit activity in NFT trading networks.  
This post is primarily aimed at providing educational material regarding NFT's and the authors are not blaming any particular NFT, creator, or project.

Traditional financial markets enjoy a significant presence of regulators enforcing a sea of illegal activity. However, most enforcing is trivial as user information is disclosed to regulating bodies linking each account to a real identity. Algorithms for detecting such patterns are not directly applicable to decentralized markets where only a pseudonymous identity is available. In other words, a user can have many wallets, and unless a centralized KYC platform is used, linking wallets to users is difficult. Prior research concentrated on examining NFT trading graphs to find recurring patterns that would indicate illegal activity. However, the ability to create wallets at fiat makes these efforts inadequate.

Our method takes a different approach. Here's how we did it.

# Our Approach: Linkability Network

The core of our method lies in the integration of **NFT trading graphs** with the entire **Ethereum Transaction Network**, creating a **Linkability Network**. Here’s how it works:

* **NFT Ownership Traces**: We track the historical transfers of ownership for each NFT, capturing every instance of trading or transfer.
* **Ethereum Transaction Network**: We extract and map the entire transaction history of Ethereum accounts involved in NFT trading, focusing on direct transfers of ETH between accounts.

The result is a directed graph that highlights potential collaborations or shared ownership across wallets that engage in wash trading. These connections, revealed through normal Ether transactions, indicate a high likelihood of coordination between wallets, even if no direct NFT trade is observed.

As commonly said, a picture tells a thousand words.

https://preview.redd.it/2ak5wznkhltd1.png?width=794&format=png&auto=webp&s=c9555a299e406754f015e8bb8f516f40ac4b3091

The images above are examples of NFT trading graphs that our algorithm computes. The trades where the NFT was sold are edges colored red; the green edges are transfers between two accounts, and finally, the purple dotted lines are accounts historically linked on the Ethereum network. The proposition is simple: two or more accounts buying/selling/transferring the same NFT between them while having had transactions between in ETH is hardly a coincidence.

This usually happens when two or more wallets owned by the same entity/person continuously buy the same token from one-another. However, they can only do this if they have enough liquidity, or they send the ETH back and forth to fund the next buy.

The left graph shows how the first 9 accounts are all interlinked on the Ethereum transfers. These wallets were all participating in trading the token, resulting in a significant price increase. Finally, the last 3 trades are likely honest buyers that speculated on the continuation of the price action and are now holding the token, to this day, unable to sell due to lack of buyers.

Similarly, the graph on the right illustrates the same pattern amplified both in terms of value as well as trades.

The likability network was computed by following all transactions of each participating wallet until depth 4. This took a lot of time and significant computation power. For those interested, the [data of cca. 135k NFT's](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/03370b71c433bfddf931292adbee759704774fa4b414174b14e3ff8946213d8b) and their graphs is publicly available, as is the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16603) that goes into more detail.

In conclusion, it is unfortunate that many of the market participants were unaware about these practices. Hopefully, this post will help raise awareness about these practices for those of you trading NFT's."

I feel like an idiot for not seeing the red flags early on before depositing $25,000 into their exchange. 

There is no information available about them on the internet currently and I'm hoping that this post will deter at least one person in the future from making the same mistake as me. 

After testing a few small withdrawals I deposited a larger amount into their platform. Once the time came to withdraw my funds in full they accused me of insider trading and blocked withdrawals on my account. 

I became suspicious and started researching them more thoroughly, turned out the awards on their website are fake, the company doesn't actually seem to be registered anywhere and the physical address on their website doesn't actually house their businesss.

They then said that I need to pay an ""insurance fee"" of 25% of the current account balance in order to unfreeze my account, which I did. Then they came to me again and said there was an issue with identifying the wallet which the deposit came from so I need to do it again. 

At this point I'm cutting my losses. A very bitter pill to swallow of course but I've learnt an important lesson in only using trusted and verified platforms for trading. I feel like an absolute idiot right now."

The CEX is then likely to either freeze and eventually seize it, along with the rest of the clean crypto in the same wallet.  Naturally with blacklists changing by the minute, this is a risk for any transaction entering the walled garden.

This is a little bit similar to counterfeight currency, where the black market usually discounts it from 50-80%, because it causes a risk of being seized at the point of sale or transfer (At retail, perhaps just the loss of a large bill or two, at a wholesale drug deal, the risk of loss could probably include ones good health or life as well)

So, I'm curious...is there a similar risk discount to blacklisted crypto, as it likely needs to stay outside of the walled garden, and is harder to turn into useful cash, or is it so mixable that it's not really a problem after all?  If so, what does it run?"

“Do Your Own Research” (DYOR) is not a fad but an important element of the cryptoverse. Do keep that in mind.

# India, Crypto, and the G20 Presidency

India was the first country in the G20 to call for regulation of the crypto economy, during its G20 Presidency. The idea was to bring together the top 20 economies of the world on the same page regarding regulation. That move augured well for the crypto enthusiasts in India as it was seen as the government leaning towards and accepting crypto as one of the realities of the economy.

https://preview.redd.it/xom3vysrijtd1.png?width=150&format=png&auto=webp&s=637ac4a49e5bc191bf591996ada09794c0305f6c

While India did ban crypto in 2018 until it was overturned by the Supreme Court of India in 2020, there were no such steps taken thereafter. The closest India came to a ban was when International exchanges like Binance, KuCoin, and seven others were banned from operating in India unless they registered with the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU). 

So, what is the state of crypto now?

https://preview.redd.it/jlu0w3kghjtd1.jpg?width=800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5fefbb55c5bed8125b38d778be8f51a240b8f55e

# Crypto in India | 2024 | And Forward

Nearly a year after the completion of India’s G20 Presidency, India seems to be committed to crypto regulations. The banning of the International Crypto Exchanges was seen as a step towards regulating crypto operations. Since the ban, Binance, KuCoin, and four other exchanges have already registered with India’s Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) and started operations in India. The others will follow suit as well.

Not only is India committed to regulating crypto for its citizens, but it stays committed to the larger framework of crypto regulations across countries. To jog our memory, it was India during its G20 Presidency that worked with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) – Financial Stability Board (IMF-FSB) to present a framework for crypto regulations across borders. This paper is still evolving and most of the framework was to be finalized by 2025. Thereafter, it is like a plug-and-play. Interested countries could join in and bring themselves under the global crypto regulatory environment.

So, all’s rosy then?

https://preview.redd.it/2l5f4uhlhjtd1.jpg?width=800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2f4991cb3d0f456418ad74e8818be76aeba9e585

# Rosy and Cozy for Crypto? | Yes, but Not As Much

At least, the worry that crypto could be banned in India is a thing of the past. Now, the discussions revolve around regulation, taxation, lowering taxes, allowing more participants to join the crypto economy, and the like. Therefore, as a crypto player, it is indeed a heartening site.

Also, the regulatory framework gives a sense of confidence to crypto users. After all, it was just a couple of months ago that WazirX, one of India’s crypto exchanges was hacked and set back by roughly $240 million. WazirX is yet to open operations. That’s what could go wrong and this is why we need regulation in the crypto economy.

While users may be unhappy momentarily because of the taxes and also the regulatory framework they have to adhere to, over the longer term, this will only benefit them. So, all is good. And will remain good.

Rosy and cozy, therefore? Just about there! 😊

The purpose of this is pretty simple - I can always see the price of Bitcoin, Eth, Ton, and others. (Works with pretty much any coin since it pulls in real-time prices from OKX).

It’s been pretty handy for me so far, but now I’m thinking of upgrading it a bit.

Maybe you have some feedback or better ideas? My ideas right now are:

1. I could upgrade the script so it can track the balance of the user's wallet. This could be easier to understand than the price of a coin.
2. I think it’d be awesome if the script could also display NFTs held in a wallet.
3. Displaying the price chart of a coin.

I know it's basic stuff – this was just a random weekend project. But what do you think of this idea?

Also what’s your take on OKX? Is it good enough for price tracking and calculations? I like that their API is free, unlike Coinbase, CoinGecko, and CoinMarketCap, which need a subscription.

The concept I’ve come across seems almost too good to be true. I recently signed up for Zealy and connected my MetaMask wallet, eager to get started. From what I’ve gathered, the process seems relatively straightforward: I join various projects, share some posts on Twitter, and join in on a few Discord servers. Ultimately, the promise is that these projects will send crypto directly to my wallet as I participate. 

Is that really how it works? Am I just dreaming, or is there some hidden catch I need to worry about? It certainly sounds like a fantastic opportunity, but I can’t shake the feeling that there might be more to it than just signing up and sharing posts. If this is a legitimate way to earn some crypto, I can’t help but wonder why it seems like every man and his dog isn’t jumping on board too. 

Could it be that the returns are just so minimal that it’s not worth the time and energy? Or perhaps experienced users are aware of other factors that I’m currently oblivious to? It's also possible that there are risks involved that aren't immediately apparent to a beginner like myself. I’m looking for clarity because I genuinely want to understand how to navigate this space safely and avoid falling into any traps. If anyone has insights, tips, or firsthand experiences to share regarding crypto airdrops and the Zealy platform, I would greatly appreciate it. Your guidance could not only help me but also any other newcomers who are curious about this exciting yet complex world of cryptocurrency."

Where can I trade and not have to gain 10%+ to break even after all the fees to buy, sell, and transfer my haul back to the bank? I'm an American and it seems like coinbase has a stranglehold on this market and they're basically forcing us to make a huge profit on each trade to break even.

I have a friend who lives in Panama and has an employer in Turkey who wants to pay him in Bitcoin. My friend asked if they could pay him through ACH, PayPal, or cash, but they said they could only pay in Bitcoin. However, my friend mentioned that they are ready to pay him, but it has to be in Bitcoin. Otherwise, they said they would need to send the money via Western Union to a family member in the United States first and then to my friend again using Western Union. Technically, two years ago, Panama allowed Bitcoin payments. However, I'm concerned that this might be a scam. 

If he decides to accept a Bitcoin payment for now, which platform should he use? I would prefer if there was a platform that could automatically convert from Bitcoin to USD so he doesn't lose money, considering that Bitcoin is very volatile.Right now, I'm considering recommending either Coinbase or [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/) for him. Let me know if you have any suggestions.

Also, please let me know if this is a scam and advise on what my friend should do. It would sadden me to think that a company would attempt to take advantage of a young employee. Thank you again! 

Update: My friend says that Coinbase is not available in Panama. They said that they are thinking of using Binance? Is this a safe app to use or is there another app that would be safer? "

So please don’t assume that this is one. Why am I saying this? Because I cannot make my point without referring to BTC. And, while this may come across as pro-BTC, my actual goal is to argue against alternative cryptocurrencies (alts). If my criticism of alts seems to favor BTC, it’s simply because the weaknesses of alts highlight the relative strengths of BTC. And I cannot make my argument without it.

Now, let’s get into it: Alternative cryptocurrencies are a poor investment as long as BTC and fiat currencies exist—especially BTC.

**Why?**

1. **Alts are tethered to BTC and fiat.** Most altcoins are heavily influenced by the price of BTC. If BTC rises, many alts follow, and if BTC falls, alts usually fall even harder. For example, during the 2022 crypto crash, BTC’s drop wiped out not just a lot of its own market value crashing to about $15,000 from almost $70,000 but altcoin market as well. Now you might say everything crashed. Yes. But ALTs dropped more than BTC did. BTC dropped by 70-75%ish. Alts? 95% or more. 

2. **Alts track BTC’s volatility.** If BTC takes a nosedive, altcoins typically experience an even steeper decline. This was evident in the 2018 bear market, where BTC dropped by 85%, but many alts, like Ethereum, lost over 90% of their value. Ethereum did nothing wrong. It is home to thousands of alts that still operate on it and the staging ground for many that moved to their own network later on. Yet, it suffered a crash not because it did anything wrong, but because it was pegged to BTC.

3. **Dumping for fiat can tank alts.** Let's say BTC crashes 10% causing a -10% in the price of your alt even if no one sells. Then when people start selling to fiat, it crashes further. 

4. **Many alts are centralized with a ""CEO.""** Do you remember when the founder of Litecoin, Charlie Lee, sold off his entire LTC holdings, the market reacted negatively, sending the price into freefall, even though the project itself hadn’t changed. It was trading at almost $400 USD....400. FOUR HUNDRED. Today? sub-70 USD.

So, why bother investing in alts? I’m not saying you should put your money into BTC either, but BTC doesn’t suffer from the same vulnerabilities that altcoins do. If you believe in the ecosystem and think that certain altcoins solve real-world problems, then sure, invest in any alt that you want. But if you care about the price... So, it literally feels like the success of most alts depends on BTC’s performance and the faith of holders not to sell. While BTC only depends on the faith in people not to sell.

It is like fighting a war on two fronts with alts. Actually, more like 2+ whatever else that the alt garners, from public opinion, liquidity, etc. 

------

**So, if you are going to respond, please answer this question:** Given the reasons I have given (and not given because I do not want to make this very long) on why alts suffer when it comes to price-action, why bother investing in alts at all?

At the end there is a picture mentioning Dave Kleiman. Director (Cullen Hoback) matches up and the first Producer (Adam McKay) also matches up. Could they have proof that Dave Kleiman was Satoshi? He is currently listed at 3.5% chance on Polymarket. I don't know but something about this looks real and I think the closing credit font was the same block characters I saw on the trailer. If it is true, it kind of makes sense why Craig Wright was so adamant in trying to get credit if he knew with absolute certainty who Satoshi was and that he had passed.

Lately Binance requests an automated Facial recognition as part of every login, at least in my case -- a Passkey as 2fa is no longer sufficient, it always wants at least 2 or 3 forms of 2fa and one of them is an automated Facial recognition, and it's mandatory.

If anyone from Binance sees this: please stop this nonsense! It keeps me out ... a person can grow facial fair, have swollen parts of the face from a disease, or from aggression, etc ... a host of valid reasons why a facial recognition no longer matches via automated matching!

I really hope otrher exchanges don't start with this nonsense too ... what's next? send over blood samples for DNA matching?

Edits:

1: To people who claim it's geo related: It never required facial recognition until a few weeks ago. My IP or location didn't change. My device hasn't changed (mobile). Apparently this facial recognition has started rolling out only a couple of months back.

2: To people claiming many banks and exchanges use facial recognition **for login**: which ones exactly? I've never seen or heard of any, apart from Binance. We're talking login, not KYC.

3: To people claiming facial changes aren't an issue becasue ""these systems are well designed"": clearly you haven't been hit by it, so why do you even reply?

4: To people claiming I must have done shady stuff: you guys never cease to get a kick out of acting mean, take it elsewhere.

“Do Your Own Research” (DYOR) is not a fad but an important element of the cryptoverse. Do keep that in mind.

https://i.redd.it/946pyqcmoctd1.gif

# Top 10 Economies of the World

The crypto market capitalization has topped 2 trillion dollars and the uptrend will continue in the foreseeable future. True, there will be periodic drops as in any market, but it eventually will keep getting bigger. One of the drivers of the crypto economy, in the initial days at least, is the participation of the major economies. It is a simple 80/20 principle - twenty percent of countries’ participation will lead to the adoption of crypto across eighty percent of the world population.

Talking of the twenty percent let’s first look at the top 10 economies of the world.

https://preview.redd.it/75zvytipoctd1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d04c0e71da99fb387377283b2607abc18c9cf22b

These are also the countries that led crypto adoption initially but now are at different stages of acceptance, ban, or regulation. Let’s take a look at the same.

https://preview.redd.it/b7hsywufpctd1.jpg?width=800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1306a919c0a19d5b5a0d5e9e05b2bb1581a2502a

# The Top 10 Economies | And Their Tryst with The Cryptoverse

These ten economies are the ones that had initial participation in the crypto verse and then regulation came in or a total ban followed. Let’s look at the snapshot of how they fare in the cryptoverse.

https://preview.redd.it/n6i8uufsoctd1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6e3aa3dafbc7f7b9ba045db8ada9f0815436f10c

https://preview.redd.it/kn8mokstoctd1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6f9f115664265de12cd6942d04c5a033ff03723f

While there is no direct correlation between the GDP per capita and the crypto decisions, it is just an indicator of how much money could come into the crypto economy. That said, the more important points are the decisions of individual countries to regulate or ban crypto and yet be part of a grouping (between countries) to support or operate in a crypto-based economy. While this may sound baffling, the grouping comes through to meet a common agenda.  Either way, irrespective of the agenda, cryptoverse stands to benefit.

https://preview.redd.it/b7hsywufpctd1.jpg?width=800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1306a919c0a19d5b5a0d5e9e05b2bb1581a2502a

# Is Crypto Here to Stay?

The answer to this question is not a straightforward one despite the trend confirming the same. There are many more indicators like Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) that many countries are launching. Before 2020 it was not even a thing and yet it surely has its genesis in the virtual or digital currencies of the crypto-verse. The idea of the blockchain cannot be ignored and some of the cryptocurrencies, if not many, need to be looked at closely by many countries.

Is crypto here to stay? Maybe. 😊

2545, The Memecoin Supercycle - Murad Mahmudov @TOKEN2049 ,0,1fy9km1,https://youtu.be/6nqzwdGxTGc?si=hV5UxW1bQ6YhSifW,5,2024-10-07 20:23:10,"I found this talk very fun & interesting. ""Autistically brilliant"" is a description of it I saw on twitter. Please note that this is a prediction which the speaker is making which I'm just sharing. Some points for which I think the video should be watched:-
1. Blatantly states that all crypto are basically ""Speculation first-Tech second"". Basically none of the tech they present are the real deal, but the token themselves. Goes on to state how retail doesnt actually care about all the layer 2 solutions, proofs of this & that...but about making a quick buck.
2. This is where memcoins come in. Without the tech jargon, they just present a catchy token and look to build on an organically forming community. The token itself is the asset and nothing else.
3. How most tokens go through many insider allocations before the actual ICO and can be seen in token distribution. Memecoins are flushed mostly into the retail circulation. The speaker does kinda diss on the VC types and all on this.
4. Memecoin supercycle is gonna be the major thing of next year(2025) and will collectively perform better than the ""use-case"" tokens.
5. Memecoins have the added advantage of a cult-like behaviour amongst its holders like a movie fan group/sports team ultras. Even the non-memcoin tokens try to ape this kinda thing in their marketing, cus that actually has value.

There are many more interesting & debatable points the dude makes in the video. I was most surprised to see some actual dissing on the tech behind crypto, that too at a crypto event and let's be real....they kinda are true.

Share your thoughts...does he make sense...or just a wierd dude?"

So a couple months ago I had some money laying around and I decided I wanted to try new things to see if I could earn some extra bucks. As background, I knew I could risk this money since I have a good joob and I didn't need it to survive, and I like crypto (bad combination some would say).

That's when I remembered Binance has this feature where you can copy trade people and share the profits. So I bought some USDT and sent it to my Binance account to get started.

# Initial Strategy

I have some experience with trading, but nothing too crazy. And I'm very familiar with the crypto world, I joined in 2019. But despite that, I never tried copy trading in general, let alone using Binance platform, so I wasn't really sure of what strategy to follow.

After some thought, I decided I didn't want to put all the eggs in a single basket, and decided I wanted to ""test"" the traders before giving them more money. Especially because I was going to use futures instead of spot trading.

I started testing the traders with an initial balance of 50 USDT, and I'd increase it on a monthly basis depending on their results.

I didn't know what to expect, so I chose the traders mainly on PnL/ROI, but that was pretty much it.

# First revisions

As you may expect already, choosing traders based on PnL/ROI was kind of a mistake. Some of the traders were super aggressive and used high amounts of leverage (one of them was using x125 lol), meaning that they were getting crazy returns when they won, but also losing pretty much everything when they lost.

After the first month I realized this and started searching for traders that matched a specific criteria, traders must have the following:

* Decent amount of days in the platform (+100 ideally)
* Low amount of previosuly closed wallets (less than 3 ideally)
* Decent returns but not crazy in the last 90 days (10/-50% range)
* Steady PnL/ROI chart upwards
* Low MDD (around 20% max)
* Decent sharpe ratio

As you can see, I became more selective with the traders that I choose (and I will probably continue adjusting this based on the results), and I stopped expecting quick crazy returns.

# Results

In total I copied 20 different traders and as a way to share the results, I created a spreadsheet where you can better visualize the results that I got divided by each trader:

[https://i.imgur.com/DwyokbQ.jpeg](https://i.imgur.com/DwyokbQ.jpeg)

*NOTE: PnL for traders currently open include PnL for open positions, and does not include profit sharing (usually 10%).*

As you can see, most of the traders that I started copying during first month are now closed. Main reason is that I didn't like their strategy/risk management and I didn't feel comfortable copying them, or they directly lost everything.

Luckily, second batch of traders I chose using the adjusted strategy seem to be doing good. But it's still early to jump into conclusions since I started copying them less than a month ago. I wait at least a month before deciding to give them more capital as I mentioned before.

# Final Numbers

In order to better visualize the results, I created this simple summary:

[https://i.imgur.com/MxtGKBq.jpeg](https://i.imgur.com/MxtGKBq.jpeg)

As you can see, despite all the loses, I still managed to earn 129USDT, close to 8% return in 2 months. Mainly thanks to a single trader that I deployed more capital to and did extremely good. 🙏

# Conclusions & How to continue

I think that the adjustment in the strategy was a good choice that will help me to reduce the risks when choosing traders to copy, so I will continue adjusting and improving it as I gather more data.

Also, since I wanted to have multiple options, I tested a ton of traders, but as I continue adjusting the strategy, I will start reducing the amount of new traders that I give an opportunity to so I can focus on giving more capital to the ones that I already have and that are doing good.

The idea is to stabilize the returns by having different traders with different strategies (but always inside a certain range) and start to slowly deploy more capital so I can increase the $$ returns.

# Thank you!

Hope you liked this post. I created it mainly to share the results I got and get some feedback from more experienced people.

I know copytrading is usually a very controversial topic but hopefully we can share our knowledge between us!"

Hey everyone,

Just wanted to share a heads-up about a potential phishing scam I received. I got a text message claiming to be from Binance, inviting me to participate in their ""Tombola Binance RO"" raffle. The message included a link: binance.aets-withdrawal.com.

**Red flags:**

* **Suspicious link:** The link in the message doesn't look like a legitimate Binance URL.
* **Official-looking number:** While the sender's number might seem official, scammers often use spoofing techniques to make their messages appear legitimate.
* **Urgency:** The message creates a sense of urgency, urging you to participate immediately.

**Stay safe:**

* **Never click on links in unsolicited messages.** If you're unsure about a message, go directly to the official Binance website or app to check for any promotions or raffles.
* **Verify the sender's identity.** Be cautious of messages from unknown numbers, even if they appear to be from a reputable company.
* **Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) on your Binance account.** This adds an extra layer of security and makes it harder for scammers to access your account.

**Remember:** Binance will never ask you for your private information or passwords via text message or email. If you receive a suspicious message, report it to Binance's customer support immediately.

Let's stay vigilant and protect ourselves from these scams!"

Say I want to create my own coin. 1 billion supply.

Is it possible to

-increase the supply or decrease the total supply programically? 

-reduce the value of an owners current coin. If coin has 0 activity/movement, relinquish 10% of it's value annually. Send the relinquished amount back to the system (I don't know the proper term for this) to be burned or held. So if 1 coin is valued at $10, the owner would now own 9/10, $9 vs 10/10. The Blockchain would show the coin traveling out of the owners wallet. If coin is in cold storage, it would automatically do checks before any activity is done.


It's all decentralized. You own the coin, but you can still lose it. The fine print is very clear from day 1 and does not change. "

2. **48.71%** of all transactions through Raydium are failing. 

3. Transactions will fail for a **variety of reasons** not just slippage issues. 

4. Voting consensus transactions & failed transactions massively bloat the blockchain size, **currently \~265 TB & growing fast.** 

5. Again, **TPS includes voting consensus and failed transactions**, failed transactions on most other blockchains are strictly validated before even hitting the blockchain. 

6. **Firedancer** is live on mainnet, but in 'non-voting mode' which means it cannot produce blocks and is **only doing about \~30% of what a validator does.** 

7. **RPC endpoint architecture allows operators to reorder transactions and front-run.** 

8. ***$7.5 billion SOL, is continued to be sold-off by FTX, a major unlock occurs in March 2025, and continued unlocks every month up till 2028.*** (Repeated due to importance). 

9. **5 million daily active users is a myth, 4.5 million of these hold 0 SOL, and much more hold < 1, they are created with an intention to inflate metrics,** notice the large uptick in August, also 1 user(bot) could technically have 4 million wallets. 

10. **The Top 18 validators control +33% of the entire staked Solana supply, meaning they can collaboratively block consensus and censor transactions.**

TL;DR: I added a comedy flair for ""comedy"" purposes because if someone told you that this is one of the major crypto networks you'd indeed think that crypto is a scam...

Germany and the EU are bringing about more stern KYC regulations for 2025, Kraken as an example chose to push their DE customers onto a thirdparty banking firm. The point isn't whether or not Kraken could have done something better, the point is the users are, and will always be, dependent upon the decisions of the exchanges that they use. 

If there was a way to buy and sell crypto without an exchange, then the crypto universe would truly be decentralized, and a digital currency environment truly controlled by its participants. Is this even possible, what would this look like? 

I mean, at the very birth of BTC, how did people buy it? There were no exchanges back then."

This happened in 2021 after the April peak, and again in 2022 following the 2021 November ATH.

Considering we reached a new ATH this March, and the price has been forming lower highs and lower lows since then, it makes me wonder: are we heading for another major downturn?

Historically, Bitcoin has experienced these cycles, especially after halving events. However, there are other factors to consider this time around:

* **Increased Market Maturity:** Bitcoin has gained more mainstream acceptance and institutional adoption. Could this potentially dampen volatility?
* **Macroeconomic Uncertainty:** Global economic conditions are playing a role, and these are different from previous cycles.
* **Regulatory Scrutiny:** Increased regulation could impact investor sentiment.

Personally, I'm a bit anxious, especially after my experience with Mt. Gox. I'm hoping to avoid another major crash, but I also know that anything is possible with Bitcoin.

What do you all think? Are we in for another deep correction, or are there reasons to be more optimistic this time?"

Then we entered the institutional period, where it seemed like crypto would move into a phase of real maturity and strong development.  
But what did we get after 2021?

**BTC**: A rally driven by the promise of a Spot ETF, after crashing to under 20k. Maybe the Spot ETF is the only good thing after 2021.

**NFTs**: A bad joke that didn’t hold appeal among celebrities and didn’t help the market in any way.

**Consecutive SEC lawsuits**: Almost every project issuing tokens was pursued by the SEC, undermining the market’s legitimacy.

**Frauds**: Scandals like FTX and other frauds further tarnished the market’s image.

**Memecoins**: The frenzy around meme coins adds chaos and gives critics more reason to dismiss this market as not serious.

**Venture Capital shitcoins**: Billions of locked tokens being dumped on us on a regular basis by greedy capitalists who did little to help the market with their second-layer or ghost chains.

To be clear, I’m not saying this because I’m frustrated or lost money in the market. Crypto has given me a lot, but that doesn’t stop me from having a critical view and pointing out these unpopular issues."

Gox.

In this setup, I could use two randomly generated emails exclusively for security, with randomized, long passwords. These emails would serve as recovery for each other, with added security like a hardware key (e.g., YubiKey).

For my Coinbase account, I might use an extremely strong password and require a security key for access. To further secure the assets, I could set up a vault with a withdrawal delay and whitelist addresses to give me time to react to any suspicious activity.

For redundancy, I might manage passwords using physical pieces of paper and store duplicate security keys in separate bank safety deposit boxes.

Would this approach be robust enough for protecting my crypto assets, or are there any potential vulnerabilities or improvements that I should consider?

DO NOT TELL ME TO TAKE IT OFF COINBASE! It is unwise for a beginner to do that and Coinbase has some good options."

There are locations in my country where heat is not working during winter and it has become an reality and also a joke that students just leave their computers open 24/7 to mine crypto and to also generate some heat.

Let's say that the said energy is free (the student dorms are paid for the living, but not for the electricity), wouldn't it be a good strategy to grab any computer you have with a mediocre GPU, let it mine 24/7, make some amount of money, and with it later buy performant GPU's for mining, having a source of money that covers a little of the rent + the lacking heat?

(Ofc, I want more critic about the mining with mediocre GPU's part)

Hi all, 

I did take my time reading through the rules of this subreddit, and concluded that this would be a welcome post for the group here. 

I am an individual that has been fixated on analyzing and understanding Bitcoin over the last 6-7 years now. My track record has included suggesting a buy zone / long entry at 16,500 December 2022, with a target price of 65,000. As you can imagine at that time, I was laughed at quite a bit, considering at that point in time Bitcoin had broken and retested a major Bearish Pennant pattern on the daily time frame. 

I’ve come to learn that Bitcoin moves by not only liquidity, but specifically liquidity from stop loss orders - due to the dominance of high leverage usage on the exchange platforms people trade futures on. 

I have laid out my anticipated scenario here for you in a very clean chart. The flash crash scenario moves as follows; 

1) 62,200 to 35,000

2) 35,000 slight retracement up to 43,000 zone 

3) 43,000 to 7,000 - 10,000

This however is not a DOOM scenario for Bitcoin, it would be a liquidity sweep prior to a Bull Market on BTC / equities spanning out 1-2 years and likely resulting in a 120k to 240k BTC value. 

While many argue that a black swan event is required to move the market in such an extreme manner, I disagree. 

I propose to you that crypto is the trading market that deviates from the logical restrictions we give to price flexibility in Equities and Forex markets. Crypto is (A) a weekend operated market, (B) price movement is dominated by high leveraged futures positions, and (C) exchanges and market makers benefit directly from traders liquidations and fees paid when opening positions. We can deduce from these three points that there is more interest against traders succeeding by the very platforms they trade on than any other market, and furthermore, an interest in sudden, fast, and extreme movements aimed to liquidate inattentive traders. We can also understand that being a weekend market, untied from the associations to equities and forex hours, it is an animal of its own intentions. Lastly, I will lay out further information in detail about the hidden power of futures stop losses driving the price of Bitcoin in fast and extreme movements, which is the mechanic I propose makes this trade possible and DOES NOT rely on any sort of black swan event to occur. 

I’ve spent a lot of time on this theory, and while I can write and write essays in this post, I will update in the comments as we progress as well as answer any questions. 

Understand this is not a matter of having a dislike for Bitcoin or cryptocurrency, I truly have no emotional attachment to what I trade. I am of the opinion that the liquid value of Bitcoin has no strong correlation to its value as a technology and its function as an asset. If this was to occur, I foresee it happening very quickly, and equally quickly returning to its $50,000 + price and climbing over the next years to upwards of $150k. 

I’d like to encourage keeping comments and discussion on the basis of respect of understanding price movement of Bitcoin (and relatively all cryptocurrencies) - and refrain from making this a personalized discussion of taking any sides. In other words, I am an analyst interested in price movement. Price moves up and down always, not one or the other. 

The last information I will leave on the main post is a summary of how I have come to understanding and trading Bitcoin over the last 6 years of trial and experimenting. 

Here are key points of the way I approach Bitcoin, that I feel are unique and worth mentioning. 

1. The vast majority of bitcoins movement is caused by stop loss orders cascading one into the next, and performing pre-determined chain reactions as they are filled. The market is dominated by futures trading; and this has a major effect on the spot price of Bitcoin. A trader using $100 for a long at 100x is leaving in the form of his stop loss; a $10,000 limit sell order that fills ONLY if price crosses over / below. Unique to limit orders that fill automatically if price is at a premium or discount, stop losses stay in tact until price passes them. Retail traders and those placing orders are only crawling the market along until it begins hitting those stop losses. That’s why bitcoin volatility comes at odd times - the reality is, it’s not caused by human engagement. It’s caused by the decisions traders have made in the past. 

2. Exchanges and market makers profit off of liquidation fees and interest on leverage. Stop loss placement is protected information for a reason; the exchanges and market markets communicate this information, to allow themselves to benefit and you to commit more money to the market. 

3. The Bitcoin chart works on trendlines that cut through - this is often when we see as price consolidation. Bitcoin easily weaves inside and outside of these trendlines due to stop losses sending price to fill the order chains. The invalidations are simply a phenomenon of futures trading prominence. Eventually, one side catches just like a normal trendline - in an abnormal relationship because price is never neatly contained inside or outside - that’s what makes bitcoin prediction so difficult. 

4. DXY is still the best predictor of Bitcoin volatility and as to which direction listed in point 3 will execute. Especially when DXY is approaching a major pivot or direction change, Bitcoin reacts very well with moves to liquidate the opposite side before DXY has a lengthy downward or upward movement (Bitcoin generally moves in opposition).

5. Market manipulation is subtle and occurs with consolidation. Price is contained and controlled, by MM placing counter orders to balance the price moving too far into a particular direction. The consolidation periods attract futures positions for their stop loss orders - and that’s the function that makes moving Bitcoin in the favour of the exchanges / MM in a way that benefits them and also in a way that’s legitimate - as it’s in fact caused by traders own choices. The counter balancing / controlled consolidation is a practice that on paper “prevents manipulation” and “increases liquidity to reduce volatility”. Quite clever. 

6. Since stop loss orders are limits placed in the chart that don’t fill automatically if price is above or below - we can analyze the open gaps on the chart along with consolidation periods to develop a good sense of the stop loss orders in the chart and where price is likely to move. 

7. Stop Loss orders helps us to predict not only direction, but also the speed and distance Bitcoin will move. The more stop losses; the greater the speed of the compounding movement and cascading effects. The longer the consolidation periods, and the larger the gaps are that price has not recovered; the more stop losses are in place. In other words, the movement of Bitcoin is predetermined and thought of like a chain of explosives that are fused together. As soon as that first stop loss triggers, the more exponentially the speed increases as the orders are already in place - and hence why we see many large wicks in Bitcoin. 

8. The fiat conversion of Bitcoin is very fluid and not a firm metric for Bitcoins health. Liquidity can move in and out of the balloon of Bitcoin extremely fast. The finite quantity of Bitcoin and its scarcity and quantity, is not relative to the fiat conversion. One bitcoin is one bitcoin - whether it is at $10 or $100,000. The fiat evaluation of Bitcoin is more-so determined by the “online casino” of sorts that takes place inside the container of Bitcoin; giving us a volatile, moving fiat conversion that ultimately is not relative to the value of Bitcoin as it’s own entity - it’s only relative if Bitcoin is converted back into fiat.

9. There are several hard limitations that stock and equities share that Bitcoin does not. Company share values are limited by the anchors they have in the real world - IE employees and wages, product sales, infrastructure, supply / demand. The evaluation of these companies is not nearly as fluid as Bitcoin for these reasons. The companies are directly related and tied to the system of the economy. Bitcoin, on the other hand, does not have these reality anchors that provide floors and ceilings to price movement. 

10. There is a degree of human intentionality behind Bitcoins chart and movement. In other words, more so than any other asset, its price projection is planned by human design. The market is funded upon liquidity from retail traders, predominantly in futures markets. The business of exchange leveraging is astronomical, and Market Makers control the great majority of liquidity via their automated systems and order placement services. Join that information with the profit structure and beneficiaries of our liquidations; and we can base a logical conclusion that there is a sole vested interest in the way Bitcoin’s price moves. That is; in favour of liquidating the common Joe and Jane. This allows us a unique advantage to be able to strategize with a business-focused mindset, more so that any other asset class. This is largely due to the lack of regulations and available information with international crypto exchange platforms and Market Makers.

And the thing is I don't know how many are there providers, and which ones can help me because there are few things to mention:
-I'm in EU
-I just moved to a country that is a part of EEA, so if I need to go through verification process, I can do it o ly w my residence permit, but I also got a government document saying where I'm staying
-I'd like to have as less fees on withdrawal as possible. Nobody likes to pay country taxes for some extra hard working $, yet alone see that $ getting swallowed by some extra fees.

What I've tried but didn't work:
Coinbase, ByBit, Kucoin, Binance.. (maybe I could get kucoin to work but there are no infos avout fees on their app)

What Ive tried but could work:
Bitpanda, crypto.com, and maybe few others, I'm not sure.
Although I'm sceptic about crypto, since I need to get coins in order to get a better card, and I really don't have any extra $ to throw for that.

Do you guys got any recommendations? I'd be happy to hear them!"

Every exchange has delisted it because it works too good as a privacy coin.

There are powerful people shorting Monero, from institutions on Kraken (you need $10M minimum to be able to) to prominent people in the financial and crypto community.

The price is suppressed, go ahead and look at the chart and tell me that's normal.

The IRS has a $625k Bounty on it because It's Completely Swept the dark web and bitcoin is now considered a honey pot.

Crypto and normal news outlets have been threatened to not cover it like they did Bitcoin back in 2013. Any news must be negative.

Monero is a way to opt out from dystopia. In a world with the CBDC on the horizon and financial privacy being a thing of the past.. you now have an escape from the bankers who have started all wars and steal your wealth.

Only considering ""relay"" like nodes, not validators.

To me, having Mcap/node > Bitcoin's means your network could be overvalued given current centralization/lack of decentralization. It could also mean that the market is pricing in future benefit/utility provided by a network despite its current lack of decentralization. Any of these networks could become more decentralized going forward, I'm not trying to knock them, although BNB is a bit concerning to me lol.

\*Note: Solana numbers are from 2023, I could not find anything more current. I had to subtract consensus nodes from total nodes to derive the number of rpc nodes.

I could not find node counts for TON, ADA, AVAX, or LINK taht did not include validator counts, if anyone can point me to that information I would appreciate the help!

Assuming that he is alive it can be assumed that he may post comments from time to time. 

I personally think that he is an individual who has extra time on his hands. He most likely is wealthy so he does not need his bitcoin. 

It’s my hope that Mr. Satoshi has found a place where he is happy. 

I also believe that he has registered for another email address because the one at GMX probably has been spammed alot. 

I hope that he has been living a good life away from all the drama and negativity that some people have. 

I hope that he is able to work somewhere in the industry. If he reveals his fine most likely can get a job with any cryptocurrency company but right now he can’t put it on his resume and if he does he will probably not get hired.

I heard you can use crypto to avoid transfer fees, conversion rates and transfer times. By buying lets say 5k USD of a stable coin which im guessing is an immediate thing? Then simply send it over to the person you wanna send it to, where they can then sell it and receive the money immediately.

Anyone know the exact method for this? and what services to use to do this? we both have no experience with crypto so any advice would be really appreciated."

A dozen congressmen intensely grilled the SEC commissioners about all their shady and lawless practices. These are the best parts: https://x.com/BanklessHQ/status/1838602054115512769

Gary Gensler was unable to respond to most of the responses and kept waffling. There were multiple times where congressmen got so pissed off with Gensler that they interrupted him and let SEC Commissioner Hester Pierce respond. Pierce kept agreeing with the congressmen and seemed like she was secretly happy the congressmen finally gave her a voice.

**TL;DW**:

* House representatives got the SEC to admit again that cryptocurrencies are not securities
* Got the SEC to admit that they have been purposefully been ambiguous about regulations, which caused malicious damage to the crypto industry, both to exchanges like Coinbase and to banks that serviced those exchanges like Silvergate which would done fine had the regulations not changed overnight.
* Gensler and Crenshaw were roasted multiple times
* House Majority Whip Emmer basically called Gensler a fat liar and said he lied in court. He was so pissed off at Gensler. Emmer said that the SEC broke the law and lied multiple times.
* Torres used Pokemon and sports cards to show how Gensler regulations would classify sales of collectible cards as securities. Gensler was unable to answer why sales of a Yankee's ticket are not securities and again avoids answering the question, which he immediately got called out for.
* Congressmen said that the SEC's treatment of NFTs as securities instead of as collectibles was ridiculous and a 1st-amendment violation.
* Multiple congressmen talked about Operation Choke Point 2.0 and the SEC's role in it and harming the financial industry

This is aint no bullmarket folks, it's bullshit manipulation by billionares who deserve to be hanged. They screwing around with poor peoples money who cares about 1, 5, 10, 20ks invested. I don't think all of this is contributed to the chinese new year that the chinks wanted to take their money out for shopping and 300 billion evaporated over 2 days.
